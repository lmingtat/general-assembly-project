,love,"It was Saturday July 16th, 2005, day after my brother's birthday actually. We had been over at his place with other family for a party for him. We got home at about 11:30 that night and though she was tired, I told her to wait in the living room. I ran into the bedroom and came out with my guitar and immediately she's thinking ""Oh god, what's he gonna do?"". I sit down and tell her I'd finally perfected playing a song I really wanted to play to her for the longest time: Maggie May by Rod Stewart. Yes, we were (and still are) hardcore metal, punk and grunge fans, but she liked to hear me sing acoustic songs and so sat down on the floor cross legged while I sat on the couch. I was beyond nervous. 

I had a stereo that played a version of the song without Rod's vocals and got it going. Seeing her rock back and forth with her eyes closed and a smile on her face was the best part of the whole experience. She was smiling listening to my raspy singing voice like she always did. It's funny, because the song itself is actually kind of a breakup song but I still think it's pretty. ""**The mornin' sun when it's in your face really shows your age. But that don't worry me none, in my eyes, you're everything. I laughed at all of your jokes, my love, you didn't need to coax. Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more**"". Perfect. 

And during the parts where Ronnie Wood would take over with his guitar, she'd open her eyes and just smile up at me, still rocking back and forth to the song with such love and joy. I think the final verse was her favorite part because she started playing air guitar to the mandolin that became more apparent and laughing to herself. And, through some godly miracle, I managed to hit Rod's high note when he says ""I'll get on back home, one of these days. WOOOOOOOH"" and her face lit up with such genuine surprise like I hadn't seen in a long time, and I almost messed up the ending because I was distracted by her. 

I breathed a sigh of relief that I was done and asked her ""Well?"". I expected her to give her usual snide, sarcastic response but she said it was genuinely beautiful. She didn't cry, but she was on the verge of happy tears, and all I could think to do was say ""Thanks beautiful"". I then got down on the floor with her and we embraced each other, me kissing her forehead. 

I basically did what any Romeo would do and professed my love and how much joy she'd brought me just from existing and being in my presence, and so many other things I was grateful for. I then had a brilliant idea and got an extra guitar string and tied one end to her ring finger and the other to mine, since I couldn't afford an actual ring, and dropped the bomb asking if she would marry me. She was turning beet red from holding in all her happy tears and nodded her head before giving a soft ""Yes. Fuck yes"". 

I hugged her so tight I was afraid I would break her and cried myself a little bit as she cried into my shoulder and I kissed the back of her head. We stayed like that for a few minutes before we stared into each other's eyes and...well a gentleman doesn't kiss and tell but waking up the next morning was something special. And when she got up, she said ""Well you must have drugged me because I wouldn't ever agree to something like that"" and she couldn't even finish the joke without laughing. 

It's now 2021, we're still happily married and have our beautiful girl by our side. She really is the spitting image of her mom, no doubt in anyone's mind. She may have my jet black hair and hazel eyes, but she has her face, and she has her mom's witty, funny, outgoing, adventurous personality as well.

,love,"Hello reddit! I'm Jesse. I know this is just another one of those happy sappy love posts, but I'm just in an especially good mood today and wanted to open up to y'all about falling in love with the angel that would become my wife and everything in between. Sorry if this gets long-winded, but I don't really know where's best to start, so I'll just start with the beginning.

So we both grew up in a place called Lawton, Oklahoma. My life growing up was pretty good I guess. Loving parents, had lots of friends, all that. My wife's life was a little different as her parents split when she was 13. Apparently it was a kind of amicable divorce, but it still tore her up. Anyway, one thing I loved growing up, like I'm sure a lot of you here, is music, especially classic country and blues. One of the first songs I ever mastered was Okie From Muskogee by Merle Haggard. My mom was the one who taught me and showed me how to read music and all that also. Once I got good enough, I'd spend a whole month learning a new song until I could play it off memory. Gave me such joy and satisfaction. 

I met the angel that would become my wife when we were 16, juniors in high school. She was actually new to the area and was one of those quiet yet cute and good looking gals I'm sure everyone has in their class. And she stood out not just because she was quiet, but because of her appearance: a fusion of grunge and punk with all black clothing, piercings, all that good stuff. I thought she was absolutely beautiful and I tried asking her out and she gave me a hard ""F-ck off"". Yeah, that stung. But I found out from one of her friends that she'd been into groups like Bad Religion, Screeching Weasel, Supercharger and others along with the grunge artists of the time like Nirvana, AIC, Stone Temple Pilots and Screaming Trees. 

These artists went completely over my head like an airplane. What can I say? I'm a country guy at heart. But I thought maybe if I tried and dropped some knowledge of the genre on her, she might actually like me. So I went to a record/music store, got some albums and went home and listened to them all over the weekend. What I heard absolutely blew my mind. Hearing electric guitar being played with such vigor and power like I'd never heard before was amazing, and the openness from these artists about how sad and depressed they were, especially about heartbreak and extreme stuff like PTSD, was something unique to my ears. And I genuinely started to like the music. So a few weeks later, I tried talking to her again and this time talked to her about her favorite albums, concerts she'd been to and other stuff to try and seem genuinely interested in her likes and she soon did a 180 and started to like me. Soon she started bringing her music to school and letting me listen to it on her Walkman. 

And one day, I dropped the ""I'm gonna ask her out"" ball and she was down for it and our first date was at an ice skating rink. She was terrified out of her mind when getting on the ice while I was actually experienced having played hockey when I was in middle school. I showed her the basics and she wouldn't let go of my arm almost the whole night until I finally tricked her and skated away from her quickly, and she was doing it all by herself, the first time I ever saw her smile so big. Then she punched me in the chest when she came over for scaring her. I knew it was the beginning of something awesome. 

We dated all through high school, our first kiss being at a Pearl Jam concert the same year we started dating. She was (and still is) my opposite in every good way imaginable. Where I'm mostly a go with the flow and chill kind of guy, maybe a bit vexing and kind of an a-hole, she is outgoing, vibrant, expressive, talented (especially with drawing), fearless, you name it. Nothing short of perfect. I should also mention that my parents didn't necessarily approve of our relationship given that I grew up in a very evangelical Baptist household. But I wasn't going to let this piece of perfection go just because they said so. So, we each moved out of our houses when we were 19 and this is when I fell in love with her even more. The early days of waking up next to her beautiful face and feeling safe and happy are wonderous to reflect on. She changed me for the better, and I know I changed her. 

This is also when I started to embrace my more rebellious side like she had and got loads of tattoos, mostly of icons and artwork from the bands we loved, especially from the heavy metal side from bands like Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden as well as from punk bands like Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, Joy Division and others. I have a lot of tats, but they all hold some significance and aren't just there because. Also, for clarification, I'm more into the punk, grunge, hard rock, classic rock, folk and classic country whereas she is mostly into heavy, thrash, power and alt metal. And then our world got turned upside down. 

I had gone to a local CC and finished my last two years at a nearby college to get my degree in business and was just starting my career when the inevitable happened: she got pregnant. I admit we were both scared at first, not sure how we were ever going to be able to do it as parents. But we talked it over at length and I reassured her that no matter what happened, as long as we had each other, we'd be okay. I still remember that night she layed on top of me on the couch crying herself to sleep mostly out of happy tears knowing she was gonna be a mom. I woke up first the next morning and then carried her to bed to let her sleep in and I knew somehow that everything was gonna be okay. And nine months later, our baby Louise was born, named after my wife's grandma who raised her after her parents separated. 

Louise is now 11 going on 12 and we're just one regular happy family. She definitely gets her her rebellious and artistic side from her mom, and her beautiful face from her also, but has my jet black hair and hazel eyes. For her birthday, I plan on getting her her first acoustic guitar since she loves hearing me play and sing but also equally loves the guitar music of rock and metal, saying she wants to be the next Amy Lee (Evanescence) or Ann Wilson (Heart). I'm proud that we've raised her where she has such a deep love for certain music (that isn't just metal) and also has some that isn't her cup of tea but she still respects (like my country). She also loves/hates my yodeling when I play Hank Williams (listen to Lovesick Blues, you'll get what I'm talking about) and covers her ears or winces visibly, and I do it just to make her mad. 

She's also embracing the grunge fashion trends a bit, wearing flannel, ripped jeans, boots and a leather jacket in the Winter. It's honestly so adorable and makes me a proud dad and her a proud mom. She's also into anime stuff and I have to say that, even though that stuff isn't really my thing, the artwork in those Studio Ghibli movies is spectacular. Idk how they do it, but every movie looks so unique yet you can tell a lot of the same artists worked on it together. We also do play video games together sometimes and I have a habit of making plans fall apart on accident and saying ""Oops"". Like we were playing this game called Rainbow Six and trying to gain entry into a house to rescue a hostage and I thought it was a good idea to go in through the roof so I blew a hole in it but didn't realize how steep the drop would be and died when I fell through. She laughed herself red it was amazing. 

So that's all I really wanted to talk about. There aren't enough words to describe how lucky and happy I am to have these two in my life. Idk where I'd be without them, honestly. Sure we drive each other up the wall sometimes, but it's never genuine. They're my everything.

,love,"I remember back at September 18, I had to take a flight to Malaysia to be with my family for months, but before that I surprised you and visited you. I remember getting out of the car and saw you run away from me because you didn't have your glasses so you couldn't see me ahaha. I chased after you and messaged you to turn back, and you did.

I saw your face blushing and having this biggest and prettiest smile in the world, I was so nervous and I just stood there and I felt my whole body shaking.. you came running to me and gave me the biggest bear hug in the world.. I calmed down and felt your warmth in between your arms and I just felt so safe with you.

We walked and walked with you holding on to my arm and we just go past the stores and visited your friends house just to greet them ahaha. I was walking in front of you and you said you wanted to hold me and I jokingly pulled out my hand.. and out of nervousness, I ran away from you but you chased me and grabbed my hand.

We held hands as we walked down to the park and that's where we just sat and relax with each other, holding each other tightly.. you leaned against my chest and listened to my heart beat for you, and right there.. we traded bracelets..

The bracelet I was wishing someday to give to someone and it was you... and the bracelet you got when you were successful in your surgery.

I was saddened that I had to leave so early for my flight, but I still felt this inner joy of being so close to you and holding onto me like you never want to let me go.

As I was walking to my ride to the airport, you ran in front of me and stopped me in my tracks... you went close to me and places your arms around my head, and just leaned your forehead against mine.. that day was so beautiful.. the sun shining bright, and the soft wind keeping us cool.. right there we both kissed each other for the first time.. and I am so happy you were my first kiss.. as I went to the car I saw your cheeks blushing so brightly, and you were lucky, cause my blushing caused me to nose bleed all the way to the airport ahaha.

I will never forget that beautiful day on September 18, where we took each other's first kiss.

I watched you curl up, and move a little closer. I moved closer too.

I’ve been running a hectic schedule, i’m stressed out and tired to the point that i often forget to eat proper meals, or have enough water. Currently it is nearly 3 am and i suddenly felt super dehydrated. Realised i haven’t had enough water all day. 

Suddenly i remembered, i’d had only one glass of water. The glass of water that my little sister got for me when i came home. I didn’t ask her to. She brought it to me and we talked about my day. At that moment, i didn’t think about it but right now, i feel loved. 

It’s 3 am and i feel so grateful for such moments, for people who look out for you. They tell you they love you, not with their words but with little gestures of kindness. I love you, my little one.

We weren't even together yet. We were nothing more than best friends.

You cannot stop time, but you can make it enjoyable just by having someone listen to you, having a relationship does not mean that you get offered love and just sit down, no, you, yourself get to make the person in that relationship feel loved, only then it is a healthy relation, that may remain for the rest of your life.

-/-/-/-/-
Cannot sit down and talk about how happy I feel whenever I think about this girl. First, it'd take too long; and the second, I want some ""things"" to be unknown to ""outsiders"" of our relationship, well, at least I am the one who calls what was once a relationship. But I can give a long story short:

It's been years since we actually talked in a continuous mannor, with good topics and also some chitchatt. Yesterday and today happened to be in the said way, to say, continuous. Even though I have some issues, somehow her thought, her ""memories"" and herself made me.. happy. 
After hours of conversation, it came the nighttime, and I felt like she is the one, yet again. Then I found an ad to a lofi playlist. (I am not advertising.) Hearing it created some inexperienced memories, if it makes sense, and thought ""It would be very nice, if she was in it, in real life.."" 
So I sat down and texted her something, a little, about my thoughts on her. When she replied, I thought she was going to call me, so I went started boiling some water for coffee. She didn't think of calling me, so her replies were dull and wasn't meant for a pillowtalk. When I asked her if she was busy or not, to talk, she replied ""Is this the pillowtalk?"". And I thought we were going to tall and said ""Yes."" and then she started making jokes. Maybe she didn't mean to call me. Well, it is okay, people do not want to do things at some times, but I was going to talk to her about all of my emotions, and thought this was the perfect moment for it. 
So I sat down on my bed and lit up a cigarette, with cold weather rushing through the window, and started listening to that playlist. I couldn't, and still can't, keep myself from crying, well it's been a while since I did, and.. I thought maybe she doesn't see me as I do see her. I thought this is the platonic monologue..

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never felt this before. I&amp;#39;m terrified of how invested I am, how vunerable I feel, and how crushing it would be if this does not go how I hope. I never knew falling in love could be this scary, but I want to enjoy this feeling however long it lasts.&lt;/p&gt;

No matter how much we try to love another we may experience difficulties if we do not love ourselves. To love ourselves is a precondition to loving others unconditionally. Otherwise, the person you wish to love will never be enough no matter how beautiful and loving they are. Love not only in words, but also in action and truth.

,love,"i posted something abt this a few weeks ago so here’s an update 

we had been together for almost a year when she asked for a break. we had had the most intimate and happy moments together and her ed and depression came back and took hold of her. she began not liking life and because i was the closest, she became somewhat cold to me so she could distance herself— her way of protecting both of us.

now that i’ve baited you guys with the sad part here’s the better part:

yes we broke up, but it wasn’t a bad break up at all. it started kinda rough but as we talked it got smoother and smoother and now i think we’re actually closer than we were yesterday, but not romantically anymore. we’ve both agreed to still be really good friends and to love each other but yet again, not romantically. this isn’t like the last breakup i had where i felt a huge void afterwards and caused me to be depressed. i don’t feel a void at all, i’m not depressed, because of her i feel whole again. i cannot thank her enough for the impact that she’s made on me and how drastically she changed my life. she didn’t abandon me at the start of our relationship when i was dealing w being scared of getting close to someone like the one before it, and even through dealing w her depression she still leant me a hand and didn’t forsake me. she has helped with the problems that i couldn’t deal with like my anxiety and others and so much more.

,love,"I have been talking to this girl for a few months now, and I feel like I am attached to her. I have felt pretty down lately with stuff going on and she has completely distracted me from reality and I am happier than I have been in a while. 

We have been calling on house party nearly every night for the past month. For context these calls go for \~4 hours until 3am. I am the one that initiates conversations and the calls, but I talked to her about it incase I was a burden and she told me that she ""absolutely likes talking to me"". She just isn't the type of person to start conversations (which is understandable because she is shy and is very insecure/overthinks things). She has described that she has been depressed and that she is not happy a lot of the time, along with her telling me she doesn't go out with friends or the weekend or anything screams out to me that she is probably lonely or bored. Then I thought about that more and if I was a girl im pretty sure I wouldn't stay up until 3 am because I was bored so there might be something more to it. Even if there is nothing more to it at least I am making her happy by calling her. She also seems to trust me quite a bit, she has told me stuff that she claims she has never told anyone (sensitive topics). 

I'm asking for support because I'm not sure whether to tell her my feelings or not. I don't want to ruin this close friendship we have right now. Another problem is that I'm moving to Norway soon to do university, which is on the other side of the planet for her. This would be for 3 years and I'm not sure that she would want to do a long distance relationship for that amount of time (if she liked me that way). 

I was going to send her this but idk now:

I'll be honest with you. I really like you, and I have wanted to know for a while if you feel the same way. I just can't stop thinking about you. There is something special about you. You are always kind and always willing to listen to me even if I don’t make sense half the time. You’re constantly on my mind. Days I think I just want to be your friend because I like talking to you everyday. And days where I think I just want to hug and be with you. I feel attached to you. You’re so beautiful. Not just in appearance, you just are. I love it when you laugh when I say something stupid, and just hearing your voice makes my day so much better. We are so distant and yet I feel so close every time we talk.  I am afraid what will happen if I tell you these feelings, because I don't want to ruin what we already have. I don't expect you to give me an answer or anything like that I just wanted to let you know how I am feeling.

If anyone thinks I should send it please tell me what to fix in it.

She also seems to trust me quite a bit, she has told me stuff that she claims she has never told anyone (sensitive topics). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m asking for support because I&amp;#39;m not sure whether to tell her my feelings or not. I don&amp;#39;t want to ruin this close friendship we have right now. Another problem is that I&amp;#39;m moving to Norway soon to do university, which is on the other side of the planet for her. This would be for 3 years and I&amp;#39;m not sure that she would want to do a long distance relationship for that amount of time (if she liked me that way). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going to send her this but idk now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be honest with you. I really like you, and I have wanted to know for a while if you feel the same way. I just can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about you. There is something special about you. You are always kind and always willing to listen to me even if I don’t make sense half the time. You’re constantly on my mind. Days I think I just want to be your friend because I like talking to you everyday. And days where I think I just want to hug and be with you. I feel attached to you. You’re so beautiful. Not just in appearance, you just are. I love it when you laugh when I say something stupid, and just hearing your voice makes my day so much better. We are so distant and yet I feel so close every time we talk.  I am afraid what will happen if I tell you these feelings, because I don&amp;#39;t want to ruin what we already have. I don&amp;#39;t expect you to give me an answer or anything like that I just wanted to let you know how I am feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone thinks I should send it please tell me what to fix in it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any opinions would be greatly appreciated :)&lt;/p&gt;

,love,"Mmmm yes, so my bf and I went to this really good pizza place I showed him and we're having a great time! Food was good, mozzarella sticks made my day, everything was neat.

So we're rounding to the conclusion of the meal, and we got on to the topic of husband and wife. This is not uncommon, as we are expecting to get engaged soon, talk about rings, and all and all just excited for life together.

""Haha yeah you're my husband"" I said this jokingly as he calls me Wifey all the time (which is adorable). I also call him little pet names in mandarin, one of the three languages I know.

So I remember seeing this tiktok trend where the women or men would refer to the other as the spouse to someone on the phone to make them all giddy and flustered. And I thought ""oh he would lose his shit if I did that!""

So the waitress comes around, asks if we need anything.

""Yes, can we get a to-go drink for my husband please?"" 

I have never seen a man grin from ear to ear like he did. He was all giddy and happy and he said ""I cannot believe you just did that!"" As if I do not carry this type of energy with me. This is exactly the type of shenanigan I would pull. But I did it for that smile. That dumbass, goofy grin.

Ladies, men, and those whose name may or may not be Ken, you too can achieve this stupid ass grinny smile if you follow I'm my footsteps.

,love,"My fiancé and I just bought our first house. We are in the middle of planning a wedding, and I’ve had a really bad situation with a coworker being inappropriate. It’s been a really stressful time. The stress hasn’t made me the funnest person to be around and we’ve had some bigger than normal arguments. 

I’m not used to people being willing to put in work in a relationship. I’ve been left a lot. I’ve been afraid he would leave me with everything going on. We closed on our house on Wednesday, and due to a clerical error his name got left off all the documents. We have to go back in six weeks and pay a 200 dollar fee to add his name to the house. He could leave me at anytime because currently, he’s free and clear. I’m the only one stuck. 

We don’t have any furniture yet. We have been sleeping on the floor. It hurts his back and he’s been saying how uncomfortable sleeping on the floor is. So. ....We borrowed an air mattress from a friend. It’s SMOL. I’m used to sleeping on the floor. I lived in my car for a year. It’s not the most comfortable. But I can tolerate it pretty well. I let him sleep on the air mattress last night because I wanted him to be comfortable. Or bed is supposed to get delivered Monday. 

This morning, I woke up with him next to me on the floor. Snuggled up against my back. He said he couldn’t wait until Monday to sleep next to me. He slept on the floor just to cuddle me.  I’m full of doubts and insecurities but he always seems to make them better. I cried this morning when he said that. We may be going through an extremely stressful time right now but I love him and he loves me. I slept on the floor so he could be comfortable.

We are in the middle of planning a wedding, and I’ve had a really bad situation with a coworker being inappropriate. It’s been a really stressful time. The stress hasn’t made me the funnest person to be around and we’ve had some bigger than normal arguments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not used to people being willing to put in work in a relationship. I’ve been left a lot. I’ve been afraid he would leave me with everything going on. We closed on our house on Wednesday, and due to a clerical error his name got left off all the documents. We have to go back in six weeks and pay a 200 dollar fee to add his name to the house. He could leave me at anytime because currently, he’s free and clear. I’m the only one stuck. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t have any furniture yet. We have been sleeping on the floor. It hurts his back and he’s been saying how uncomfortable sleeping on the floor is. So. ....We borrowed an air mattress from a friend. It’s SMOL. I’m used to sleeping on the floor. I lived in my car for a year. It’s not the most comfortable. But I can tolerate it pretty well. I let him sleep on the air mattress last night because I wanted him to be comfortable. Or bed is supposed to get delivered Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, I woke up with him next to me on the floor. Snuggled up against my back. He said he couldn’t wait until Monday to sleep next to me. He slept on the floor just to cuddle me.  I’m full of doubts and insecurities but he always seems to make them better. I cried this morning when he said that. We may be going through an extremely stressful time right now but I love him and he loves me. I slept on the floor so he could be comfortable. He slept on the floor because he wasn’t comfortable without me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both slept on the floor last night.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been with my boyfriend for almost 2 months by now after 3 years of friendship and it has happened (even when we were just friends) that my internal voice would say ""I love you"". It happened when I saw how he held the both of us dear, how much he cares and how he always supports me and how he seems to be so perfect for me. And I never want him to leave my life and whenever he was with someone else I would even cry cus I was so fuckin sad. I used to date other people and if they were wearing something he would wear I would just picture him wearing that and my heart would skip a bit if I imagined him that close to me.

And I've always had this internal voice saying ""I love you"" from time to time. I wrote a letter for him recently and I just started crying.

I keep writing this things because I haven't felt love in a long while and so I wanted to be really sure about him because he deserves the world and the best.

,love,"TLDR; After surviving an abusive marriage and thinking I'd never love again, I met a man who has shown me what healthy love feels like. It is such a warm, healing feeling and I just need to gush.  


I never thought I would love again. I am a survivor of an abusive marriage. My ex-husband used violence, isolation, threats, and manipulation to keep me on his leash. It took 7 years to get away and 4 more after the divorce to learn how to love myself. I had convinced myself that I didn't need anyone else, and that I would never have a family of my own despite having always wanted to. 

Last year, I met a man who did not sweep me off my feet, but rather piqued my curiosity. It took me a while to fall for him but when I did, I fell hard. I told him early on about my past abuse and the PTSD I suffer from because of it. He responded with such tenderness and care that for once in my life I felt truly understood. He is kind, caring, and gentle. He treats me as an equal partner, and shows consideration for my feelings. He says sorry when he's done something wrong, and shows his appreciation for things that I do for him. I do the same for him because I am not afraid of being brushed off or antagonized like I was before.  


We had a small disagreement a couple nights ago, only the 2nd we've ever had. As an abuse survivor, it was terrifying for me even though it was \*me\* who was upset. I cried as I swallowed my fear of opening up and told him what was upsetting me. Instead of getting defensive and fighting back like all my previous partners have, he held my hand, listened, apologized and showed me he heard and understood me. He showed the integrity of his apology through his actions in the following days as well. I didn't know it was possible to feel so much love even in the middle of a disagreement, and for that love to continue to grow exponentially after.  I felt some dead corner of my heart heal and come to life again.

 I've read somewhere that you know you really love someone when you can't describe what they make you feel, but I think that's not the case with us. 
 
 I know that you make me feel loved, that you make me feel beautiful when you look at me lovingly, or when you ask me to say appreciative things about myself out loud so that I could believe them the same way you believe them. 

 I know you make me feel happy, that you make me laugh so hard my stomach hurts, I know that I can be myself around you without being ashamed of who I am. 

 I know you make me feel grateful for meeting you, and that I don't regret the choices I've made in my past anymore, because everything I've done has led me to you; and now I love those mistakes, the stupid things I did and said, because had I not made those mistakes, I wouldn't have been around to meet you on that faithful night. 

 And, I know that you made my life a paradise, because I know that, as long as I'm with you, I'm not tired of waking up in the mornings anymore.

 I will always wait for you, even if it took a hundred years because, even before meeting you, I already knew I would be yours forever.

,love,"For most of my adult life, I’ve spent time in relationships never feeling that exact click. That exact thing that made me feel the way you do. 
You came out of nowhere, I wasn’t looking and had just about given up on the hope that love was supposed to feel different. In a lot of my past relationships, I always felt like I was asking too much. Made to believe my expectations were too high and unrealistic (this was said to me by an ex actually). 
But you changed that. You proved to me that the love I was looking for exists. You exist. 
I could cry every time I think about just how lucky I am to know you, to have you in my life, and to have that love reciprocated. 
Today you sent me a message:
“I love you so much, you are my best friend baby.” 
I don’t think you know just how much those words mean to me. 
Our love has grown and built up very fast in such a short time and at first that scared me. I would think to myself “this is too good to be true”. You have proved to me however that time doesn’t mean a thing when you know what you feel in your heart. You’re so open and compassionate and you say what you feel when you feel it. You grab my hand and kiss me when you want, you call me beautiful when I don’t feel like it, you are so sure of me and of yourself. I don’t feel like a burden, I don’t feel like I’m asking for too much anymore.

,love,"I'm a male, currently 14 years old, 8th grade, and relationships at this age fucking suck. It's all cringy ass fuckboys with basic girls overdramatizing everything and lasting 2 weeks before moving on to someone else. It's not even something I'd consider real dating. It's like people date just to ""show off"" and stuff.

I've never dated or been in a relationship up until recently, but holy fucking shit boys I have fallen in love and I have fallen HARD. it started out with her just hitting me up randomly, we have school together and we literally have every single class together. So she hit me up, we start texting, then we start calling, then we decide to meet up and hang out which was easy cus we live in the same neighborhood. Then as we hang out and talk more, things start escalating in our texts, we start flirting, calling eachother names, holding hands while we hang out, then eventually I ask her to be my girlfriend and she says yes, so we start dating, and things escalated from there and I got my first kiss. Eventually over calls things start escalating to the point where we get more sexual. Then that moves on to real life (making out naked and handjobs/blowjobs, she's explicitly stated she doesn't want to have sex yet for reasons that are obvious).

And yeah, we've been dating for a little over a month now which isn't long but oh my god I love this woman so much. In my eyes, she's prettier and more beautiful than any other model or celebrity I've ever seen, she has the most amazing optimistic cheerful personally that I love, she's Interesting and smart, not some basic chick, and she makes me feel like I've never felt before.

All my life I've struggled with depression, physical and verbal abuse from my mom, social problems and loneliness, suicidal thoughts, and all that bullshit. Even as a little kid I'd cry myself to sleep sometimes hating the fact that I was alive. Last year hit especially hard. I was depressed and suicidal 24/7, I lost alot of weight and barely ate anything, I had constant arguments and yelling with my mom, and at times things would get really physically abusive to the point where my bruises lasted for a month. I started doing light drugs like nicotine and weed to deal with stuff and suffered through some mild addiction for some time. I hated being alive and on October 6th 2020 I tried to hang myself in my garage, which failed. I hated my life and I hated being alive. I was literally in a living hell and all I wanted was for it to finally end.

Then I met this girl. And now, for the first time in my life, I wake up in the morning actually looking forward to the day knowing that she'll be a part of it. I can look in the mirror without wanting to throw up knowing that someone is attracted to my handsome ass face. I feel secure, safe, comfortable, and happy, and I will do anything I can to make sure she feels the same because she is my world and my everything. 

We have such a healthy relationship. We're open with each other and we don't keep anything from eachother, we are affectionate and intimate, I make sure to tell her every day how special she is and how much I love her just to make sure she feels wanted, and when we're together I make sure to touch her and hug her and hold her and kiss her and let her physically know how much she means to me. All I ever want to do is to make her happy, and when I see her laugh and smile and blush and feel good directy because of me, it's the most rewarding feeling in the world, knowing that I'm actually loved and valued by someone, because that's not something I've ever had in my life before.

I know we're young, we don't know much, we have alot to learn and experience, and we haven't been together for very long, but I genuinely believe that I have something special with this girl and I truly love her. I don't know much, but what I know and have heard from other people is that when you find real love, you hold on to it tight and you never let go, and that's my intentions with her, because I cannot possibly imagine myself with someone better (I've had fantasies about having the ""perfect"" relationship with the ""perfect"" girl, but none were as good as what I have with her) and I am never letting her go.

So to my gorgeous, beautiful, amazing, loving, caring, empathetic, and perfect girlfriend:

,love,"To Soulmate .. with L O V E ❤️

(Context: wine had 🍷 Feeling this rn)

So. 
It’s true that love comes when you least expect. 
But love also DOESN’T come when you expect. 

I remember talking to girlfriends in high school, and all of us saying how we can’t wait to find our man one day and be sooo in love (insert excited teenage scream here lol) 

I have always been a romantic. 
Witty, fun, spontaneous, sensual, intelligent.. casual conspiracy theory enthusiast.. part time artist.. and full time comedian. 

I always envisioned a partner being someone who you always feel sad saying goodbye to. 
Who gets my weird humour, says goodnight before sleep .. has my back if ever talking about me to others .. and thinks I’m the dam finest woman on the planet! (Or at least in his mind!) 

I would say I’m moderately attractive .. I’m kind, am easy going, loveable kind of dork. 
I have watched many in my life - even those who I least suspected of settling down - meet their partners and be blissfully happy - and even see some find that - and then also loose that. Showing me that love isn’t always easy or what it seems. 

Sure, I’ve had my share of relationships. Heartbreaks seem to come with the territory, but I’ve never let that destroy my love of romance and connection. 

I’ve been breadcrumbed.. ghosted .. FWB’ed.. led along.. loved from afar by someone in a relationship... not loved by someone that I adored - and even engaged! (Once) 

I have learned SOOO much and I am truly proud to be the loving, kind and non judgmental human I have become today. Because it’s taken some hard knocks to get here! .. but you know who I have always seemed to miss more than anyone so far in this life? The person I would give anything to meet? 

My soulmate. 

Nope. Never met the guy. Never been lucky enough to lock eyes (yet) 

But I’ve stared into space thinking of you. 
Knowing your out there (somewhere) somehow wishing you to me with my genuine love of what we could be! 

I know I’ve never met you .. but I have dreamt of all the fun we could have! The lamest jokes that only we understand.. and the way you make me laugh more than anyone. Knowing that you see how genuine my heart is for you; and others in my world. 

I haven’t ever let my dreams of you affect how I have perceived other men that have come into my world. But I know I just haven’t met “you” yet. 

There are ones who have made me feel so unlovable. Some that have also shown me that I am something to be wished for ... 

But I have always deep in my soul, known that certain relationships were never really it. Or I rationalised staying with someone - even when they weren’t really that “into me” or the other way around because .. I LOVE being with someone and giving out love and generosity to someone. 

I’ve even had guys say “you are actually the best girlfriend!” ... but when you really know in your heart that it’s not really something you would do anything to keep - your “ride or die” your co-pilot, your playmate, your cheeky, funny, romance buddy! ... it’s just not the same.

I want my soulmate to light up when I walk into a room - not just because they love me! But because I also make them feel like more of a man than anyone else had! Someone who really understands them and treats them with respect and kindness. Who does sweet things for them and also is super excited to get me home! 😉🔥 

... And have times when we hold each other and feel like we could stay in that moment forever. 

I want a BEST friend. 
A generous lover
Who forgives others easily
Who is always there for a friend 
Who is forward thinking and driven 
Who loves to succeed 
Who loves to smile .. and laugh together! 

And I want to be all these things in return! 

And now, being in my 30’s with a little angel of a girl (4ys old) and wanting more than ever a man who sees the absolute gold of a life of happiness and fun we could have...

Have I expected to much? 
Have I accepted too little?

That balance constantly throws me! 

I am constantly open 
But also constantly learning and growing. 

I don’t get EVERYTHING right
But I get a lot dam right 

I may not have met you yet my soulmate;
But I cannot fucking wait to meet you! 
And when I do .. I want to be so good to you that you’ll wonder what life was ever like before. 

I don’t know if you’ll ever read this, and most likely? You probably won’t. 

But I just needed to speak to you. And I wonder where you are .. but I hope your doing well - and that you’ll see me soon. 

Until then, there are lessons to be learned by both of us. 

So here I am universe. 
Sending out a signal to my love ❤️

Come find me. 
I’ve been missing you for so long 

Love, 
Your Girl

&lt;p&gt;(Context: wine had 🍷 Feeling this rn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. 
It’s true that love comes when you least expect. 
But love also DOESN’T come when you expect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember talking to girlfriends in high school, and all of us saying how we can’t wait to find our man one day and be sooo in love (insert excited teenage scream here lol) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been a romantic. 
Witty, fun, spontaneous, sensual, intelligent.. casual conspiracy theory enthusiast.. part time artist.. and full time comedian. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always envisioned a partner being someone who you always feel sad saying goodbye to. 
Who gets my weird humour, says goodnight before sleep .. has my back if ever talking about me to others .. and thinks I’m the dam finest woman on the planet! (Or at least in his mind!) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say I’m moderately attractive .. I’m kind, am easy going, loveable kind of dork. 
I have watched many in my life - even those who I least suspected of settling down - meet their partners and be blissfully happy - and even see some find that - and then also loose that. Showing me that love isn’t always easy or what it seems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, I’ve had my share of relationships. Heartbreaks seem to come with the territory, but I’ve never let that destroy my love of romance and connection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been breadcrumbed.. ghosted .. FWB’ed.. led along.. loved from afar by someone in a relationship... not loved by someone that I adored - and even engaged! (Once) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have learned SOOO much and I am truly proud to be the loving, kind and non judgmental human I have become today. Because it’s taken some hard knocks to get here! .. but you know who I have always seemed to miss more than anyone so far in this life? The person I would give anything to meet? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My soulmate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope. Never met the guy. Never been lucky enough to lock eyes (yet) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’ve stared into space thinking of you. 
Knowing your out there (somewhere) somehow wishing you to me with my genuine love of what we could be! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I’ve never met you .. but I have dreamt of all the fun we could have! The lamest jokes that only we understand.. and the way you make me laugh more than anyone. Knowing that you see how genuine my heart is for you; and others in my world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t ever let my dreams of you affect how I have perceived other men that have come into my world. But I know I just haven’t met “you” yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are ones who have made me feel so unlovable. Some that have also shown me that I am something to be wished for ... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have always deep in my soul, known that certain relationships were never really it. Or I rationalised staying with someone - even when they weren’t really that “into me” or the other way around because .. I LOVE being with someone and giving out love and generosity to someone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve even had guys say “you are actually the best girlfriend!” ... but when you really know in your heart that it’s not really something you would do anything to keep - your “ride or die” your co-pilot, your playmate, your cheeky, funny, romance buddy! ... it’s just not the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want my soulmate to light up when I walk into a room - not just because they love me! But because I also make them feel like more of a man than anyone else had! Someone who really understands them and treats them with respect and kindness. Who does sweet things for them and also is super excited to get me home! 😉🔥 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... And have times when we hold each other and feel like we could stay in that moment forever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want a BEST friend. 
A generous lover
Who forgives others easily
Who is always there for a friend 
Who is forward thinking and driven 
Who loves to succeed 
Who loves to smile .. and laugh together! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I want to be all these things in return! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, being in my 30’s with a little angel of a girl (4ys old) and wanting more than ever a man who sees the absolute gold of a life of happiness and fun we could have...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have I expected to much?

,love,"To the love of my life, it's been 6yrs since we've been together and not once do I regret it. I've made mistakes in our relationship that I do regret but not you. There have been some terrible things done and said by both parties, but as we started to grow, we learned how to handle them better. We met when I was 17, and you were 19 and I fell head over heels. But the last relationship before you destroyed me. It hurt so much that I began to self sabotage ours for awhile until I grew out of the habit. But it wasn't till after our anniversary on Feb 23rd, you seem different. Before then, I noticed but it wasn't as prominent till then. My gut told me something was up.

When you went to work, you'd call me on your breaks. Even with nothing to talk about, or sometimes you'd catch me while gaming (out of work due to COVID), I still loved listening to you ramble about work. Now those calls have stopped, when you come home, you toss me my snack and head straight for the PC. Your streaming friends have become more important then me. My gut began to bother me more and I finally went through one of your social medias. Your activity showed links to OnlyFans (people get your bag) but they were of things I was insecure about. They were blonde, and gifted with a stunning figure.

The next were your cousin's ex girlfriend's links to other socials and the same for another one of your cousin's best friends. I've met both at your family's traditional camping trip. And they are stunning, beautiful women. Again, blonde and beautiful inside and out. But bring it back to last night. The night where I'm learning we may not be meant for each other. I heard you talk to another girl, but the tone was different, it was flirty. And as I sat in bed, listening to your friend's stream, I heard my heart break. Quickly I run to take a shower, only to collapse in a raging anxiety attack. You never heard it, you never questioned why I got up out of bed so fast, you didn't care.

It wasn't till over an hour past, you noticed something. When I received your text of getting intimate, I got frustrated and went on a small rant to myself in the bathroom. But took a deep breath and decided it might be me overreacting and went back to bed waiting. I waited 20mins until you told me to rain check. I sat up on our bed and quietly wept while you didn't even notice. To my darling, the one I love with my whole heart, I am not her. I'm sorry I'm not her. I'm sorry I cannot be the one you want or desire. I'm sorry that she isn't in my place.

We go into love pretty blindly sometimes–not knowing how to handle the tough situations when it comes to communicating with our partners. 

Through it all–the ups and the downs–we learn what we want out of relationships and what we don’t want. There are a lot of things people wish they knew before getting into serious relationships. 

So I made this [video](https://youtu.be/a0QfDV4eQPE) compilation of everything I wish I knew before getting into a relationship.

Our families' still hopes we'll get back together, but 5 months since we ended and 2 months after I learned you already replaced me, I am starting to clearly see why we did the right thing breaking up.
-
I didn't like the woman I turned into after I said 'yes' to you three years ago. You were very sweet and loving, but for me it only feels like you're doing it so I won't leave you. 
I am looking for something deeper than cuddles, hugs, and kisses, I want us to grow together. You also mentioned you want us to grow together. But our life plans were different: you're the type who'll use all of your free time playing online games while I am pursuing career advancement. We don't have much of common interest that I even felt like I have to learn to play games so I can jam with you. I ended up wasting thousands of hours on these games that I could have invested on myself. Of course, I am to blame. But it just felt like, there's no room to grow together for both of us. I gained 25kg in those 3 years, became bitter and resentful, and generally miserable. Now I am begining to see why I was so depressed when I'm with you. 
-
On our two year mark, everytime we quarrel, the first thing that comes to mind was to breakUp with you. I never ever cheated on you, but I can hear a voice inside me that says you're not the right person. ""I want to be available for the right person."" I remember myself wishing on my birthday for me to find a way to split with you peacefully, and Universe granted it, plus made sure there's no going back for you already found a gamer girl (you never met IRL) to replace me.
-
Still here, single and not looking for someone, healing myself and going all-in in my self-improvement. My suicidal thoughts and anger instantly stopped on that day. I am understanding my depression and is able to go deep inside myself and tend to the unresolved past traumas. I get lonely sometimes and still misses you, after all I'm 27 and I'm nearing the danger age.
-
I might never find love again and die old... But I think breaking up with you for real is the best thing that ever happened to me.

Our families&amp;#39; still hopes we&amp;#39;ll get back together, but 5 months since we ended and 2 months after I learned you already replaced me, I am starting to clearly see why we did the right thing breaking up.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t like the woman I turned into after I said &amp;#39;yes&amp;#39; to you three years ago. You were very sweet and loving, but for me it only feels like you&amp;#39;re doing it so I won&amp;#39;t leave you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;I am looking for something deeper than cuddles, hugs, and kisses, I want us to grow together. You also mentioned you want us to grow together. But our life plans were different: you&amp;#39;re the type who&amp;#39;ll use all of your free time playing online games while I am pursuing career advancement. We don&amp;#39;t have much of common interest that I even felt like I have to learn to play games so I can jam with you. I ended up wasting thousands of hours on these games that I could have invested on myself. Of course, I am to blame. But it just felt like, there&amp;#39;s no room to grow together for both of us. I gained 25kg in those 3 years, became bitter and resentful, and generally miserable. Now I am begining to see why I was so depressed when I&amp;#39;m with you. &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;On our two year mark, everytime we quarrel, the first thing that comes to mind was to breakUp with you. I never ever cheated on you, but I can hear a voice inside me that says you&amp;#39;re not the right person. &amp;quot;I want to be available for the right person.&amp;quot; I remember myself wishing on my birthday for me to find a way to split with you peacefully, and Universe granted it, plus made sure there&amp;#39;s no going back for you already found a gamer girl (you never met IRL) to replace me.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Still here, single and not looking for someone, healing myself and going all-in in my self-improvement. My suicidal thoughts and anger instantly stopped on that day. I am understanding my depression and is able to go deep inside myself and tend to the unresolved past traumas. I get lonely sometimes and still misses you, after all I&amp;#39;m 27 and I&amp;#39;m nearing the danger age.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might never find love again and die old... But I think breaking up with you for real is the best thing that ever happened to me.
We&amp;#39;re terribly matched, we&amp;#39;ll just wither and die young together.&lt;/p&gt;

,love,"Hello, so I'm in love with a friend of mine G,she is 18 years old like me. She doesn't know that I'm in love with her, but I've thrown in some hints here and there.

Ever since we've gotten back into talking I've been really happy to speak to her again (her bf won't let me talk to her at All, I would wait weeks with no texting, I send 1 message and he threatened to kick my ass and thank God shes no longer with him) there is just a single problem tho. I'm in love with her, we have met a year ago at a culinary school. We gave each other our phone numbers to keep in contact, (we had a small group of friends to chat with) but she caught my eye straight away.

But I moved up to Marquette, and she is down state by like Stanford or something I don't remember where she lived. I'm about 6 hours away to get anywhere down there but I can only stay for 2 days until I have to leave for school the next day.

Ngl I honestly don't do well by ""getting the girl"" because it usually ends up horrible, and I'm embarrassed to talk about any love interests because I had no one to love up until now. She is a very different type of person your used to meet
.
I have about over a half a page long in my small notebook/journal about how much she means to me, a bit about my feelings, etc still working on it. But I don't know if I need it at all or just tell her I love her (which never works out for me if I say that to Any type of girl).

So my question is do I wait until I say something or do I say them now? (I know it's a stupid question, but I'm questioning myself about how I really feel) because I rather not be pushy or forceful, but I also rather not turn them off because of it.

The thought of living our lives separate feels inconceivable, you are my fire which keeps me warm and my soul is where you keep your heart safe with me.

I don&amp;#39;t have anywhere else to go and at this point it&amp;#39;s stupid of me to ask, but what is it like to love someone? Why is it that so many people chase after this feeling only to either end up losing it or never really having a clear answer on what it is? How do I learn to love myself so that I can start loving others again? Why should I keep grabbing onto non-existent hope that love will come my way? Is it ok for me to just let go and give up on love?&lt;/p&gt;

I dated a girl who was from the UK and only was in the states for a year for school. I happened talk to her during her last 6 or 7 months in the states before she had to go back to the UK. Everything was perfect between us the first 6 months of our relationship. We dreamed of either me coming to the UK to live with her or her trying to get a visa to live with me in the states. We basically setup our whole lives together, with kids, marriage etc etc. Then after she left the states some things changed. I was goin thru some money issues in my life and was gonna be homeless so I scrambled some money up and got my own apartment, she also helped me with money to get my apartment and she wanted me to pay her back, which at the time due to me spending all of my money on this apartment I couldn’t in time. This started the arguments. This escalated when I didn’t have enough money to get her something for Christmas, she made a really big deal bout this, which I understand and when she had time in her schedule she came to see me for 2 weeks I made up to her and gave her a bunch of gifts to make up for it. She basically shrugged it off and after she left and we had a another argument she threw it in my face like I didn’t just try to make it up to her.

We had a great walk together we both got cute and handsome and even though we didn’t take any pictures we still got to spend time outside of the house and although we were going to stay home one of us to watch mom and poppy. We went out and now we’re going home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find love anywhere. I got to hear about how he’s calm when he was a child. I got to hear about how certain things used to be exhibit. And even though we couldn’t go inside. We got to see some cool things anyways along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you can find love anywhere. ❤️❤️❤️&lt;/p&gt;

,love,"No matter where life may take me, my eyes will never stop searching for you…the other half to my soul. It was love at first sight though you would never know. Over taken with feeling so strong and new, but you had another I didn’t know what to do. My heart you were stealing and yours I wish I had too. 

Two minds so alike, yet with lives so contrasting. With a bond forming so deep, each moment was everlasting. A perfect imperfection between us, an astonishing connection. Could this feeling be an illusion, obscured by our obsession? 

We both took a chance, despite any doubt or fright. Forever in each others loving embrace, We let our fragile hearts dance throughout the night. Feelings of love grew and grew, blossoming into something oh so rich and new.

I am no longer unsure, as I know it is true. I am where I belong, and that is with you. Two wicks ignited by chance, our flames burn at a safe distance. Self-sustained, but exhausted, flickering under constant shifting winds and fueled by unexplained attractions. 

Both afraid….to let love consume us and deplete the darkness, we replenish each other’s illumination without being extinguished within.  Hand crafted and hand picked by the universe to lighten up the dusk with one another’s dawn…

By your side, is where I belong indeed because I am in love with you Reed.

,love,"I found a few of the paragraphs i sent her one night a few months ago, just thought i would share because this girl means the entire world to me. Hope you all enjoy it :) 

well baby i know i go on rants a lot about how much i love you, but it makes me happy to say amazing things about you, and i hope it makes you happy :) so here’s just a couple things i typed out that were on my mind about you 

baby, literally the day you entered my life, nothing has ever been the same. im always thinking about you, i want to be with you literally every second and just miss you so much, like ive never wanted to be with someone more more

i love everything about you, and i mean that, i literally love everything about you. And every single day i feel like i grow more in love with you, every day i just wake up and feel my love for you grow

it amazes me just how much i still have to learn about you and grow closer to you. Like just when i think i know everything about you, etc we have a conversation on the phone until 2 am and i realize that i really still have so much more to learn 

and im so excited that i will be able to grow closer to you every day, i want to know every single thing about you. Whether that be the small things, or big things, i want to know everything about you baby and i can’t wait :)

i really do love you so much and just love talking to you and being with you

i love how you hold me, i love how you tell me im cute, i love how all the laughs we have together, i love the dumb and joking conversations we have on the phone, i love just even being able to talk you on the phone and spend time with you

i love how you make me happy, i love how i smile when i see you or think about you,  i love how you laugh, i love how you care about me, i love how you always know when somethings wrong and you ask me about it, i love how you make me feel

i love how we can talk about anything for hours, i love how i can never ever get bored of talking to you, i love it when you say kind and sweet things to me, i love hugging you and just having you in my arms, i love cuddling with you

i love how we message each other when we wake up, i love how much you love me, i love how you want to spend your time with me, i love how you want to spend your future with me, i love how everything is perfect with you

i love how you see me for who i am, i love how you make me cry, not from being upset or sad, but because im the happiest and luckiest guy on this planet, i love how i wake up in the morning and immediately think of you

i love how i anticipate to see you, i love how i get nervous when i see you, but im more comfortable with you than anyone else, i love how you tell me everything is going to be okay and you calm me down

i love how you would drop anything for me or do anything for me, i love how i only want to be with you, i love how you make me happy

i love how i can see myself with you forever, i love how we talk about being together forever

i love how i know that i have found the love of my life and that i am going to spend the rest of my life with the most amazing girl

I don’t want to get in the way of her recovery which is why I’m probably going to back off.

Like a collection, so that all us singles on here can collect ideas for later, when love comes and gets us 😜

I'll start.

... Sometimes I imagine HIM just brushing his hand across my back when I do something totally unimportant, like get a glass of water or sth, and he just can't resist, so he takes the things from my hands and pulls me tight, against the kitchen counter or whatever, and gives me the deepest, most electric kiss I've ever felt. It makes my heart flutter and when he pulls away he just smiles at me, and maybe whispers that I look beautiful. Then I go back to getting my glass of water...

&lt;p&gt;Like a collection, so that all us singles on here can collect ideas for later, when love comes and gets us 😜&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... Sometimes I imagine HIM just brushing his hand across my back when I do something totally unimportant, like get a glass of water or sth, and he just can&amp;#39;t resist, so he takes the things from my hands and pulls me tight, against the kitchen counter or whatever, and gives me the deepest, most electric kiss I&amp;#39;ve ever felt. It makes my heart flutter and when he pulls away he just smiles at me, and maybe whispers that I look beautiful. Then I go back to getting my glass of water...&lt;/p&gt;

,love,"You are the love of my life. 

Out of the hundreds of pleas for company you replied to mine and I consider myself the luckiest girl on the planet for that. 

I hurt you today and I’m sorry. Being sad or going through something with my mum is no excuse for saying those insensitive things I did and I really do wanna apologise again. 

You are the reason I wake up in the morning. You’re the reason I eventually do drag myself out of bed and go on a walk with Archie. Your voice is what puts a smile on my face. I would give up anything to preserve those moments with you because you’re my everything. 

I wish today had been a better day. I wanted to tell you all about the exercise science lab I had today but as we both know I got... derailed. Out of the blue, so much so that I didn’t even see it coming and yet you never blame me. Why don’t you ever blame me? How is what I hear from you so different to what I hear from everyone else? 

You truly deserve the world and I hope one day I’ll be well enough to give it to you but I know that you’ll be with me every step of the way until I do. I found it so hard to tell you about the dark stuff I was thinking and you could see it triggered my anxiety so much but I didn’t want to keep it from you. You’re my boyfriend... the man I love and I want to always be honest with you.

This isn’t a sad post, it’s a happy one, a hopeful one. It’s me putting a wish out there into the world so that I can gain the motivation to work towards that tomorrow we always dream about. Because at the end of it all I really want to be holding your hand and looking back at our wonderful life together. 

I don’t really believe in god but if he’s out there listening then I only ask one thing- a happy and fulfilling life with the man I love and please, no more panic attacks. 

I love you more than anything and anyone and... today was a slip up but I’ll try to keep working on getting better. Just please don’t leave my side baby.

A long time ago, I felt and wrote for all the wrong reasons. I forced myself to feel. I forced myself to write. A part of me knew that I was pretending everything was perfect. But this was during a time where I didn't know myself. 

I could Google definitions and steal metaphors from my favorite poets, pulling and tying the strings into what I thought was a beautiful canvas. Instead, it was a spiderweb I trapped myself in. I filled my head and heart with lies, and I was heading down such a dark path. I felt it in my bones; the impending doom of a sadness I've never cried before. 

Something happened before that point. On that day, at one in the morning, you found me. At first, I didn't truly see you. I felt a shift, but the timing made me dismiss it. I saw a beautiful stranger that could be a friend that I needed. 

You know the rest. You've been with me through every obstacle. You've helped me unravel and cut every spiderweb I created around myself. You pushed me to discover who I truly am. You made me want to open my eyes and see the reality that I had been painfully ignoring. 

Because of you, I've learned to accept myself. I don't badger myself every morning I wake up. I don't get angry when I eat. I actually love who I am. I love my uneven eyebrows. I love my big nose. I love my loose and textured skin. I love my hide-and-seek freckles and flaky red hair. I love me. Not just because of you, but because I truly see who I am. And I like it. 

Because of you, I've experienced genuine love for the first time in my life. I feel appreciated. I feel loved. I feel accepted. I feel needed. I feel wanted. I feel heard. You've made me experience all of the things I've always dreamt and conjured of into my poetry. I receive it unconditionally. Full force. 

Life still continues, and it's not roses and daisies every day. I still cry from stress. I get upset if I overeat. I'm afraid of being a failure in my future. Sometimes, I forget how to love myself. But you're always there. Every time. We always pick each other back up. You keep me on my toes. You make me want to keep trying. 

In the span of one year knowing you, not once have I ever felt truly lost or unloved. The moment I found you, I knew in my bones it was home. I don't believe in religion. I'm not sure I believe in fate. But the way I felt when we met, it's not real. It cannot be expressed into words. It's unearthly. It's inhuman. It's more than any poetry read or written. 

Every second spent with you is the most wonderful gift a person could receive. Being in love with you is the most raw and genuine feeling a human could ever experience. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. There's not a single doubt in my mind. When I look at you, I literally stop breathing. You are the most beautiful human being I've ever seen, inside and out. I'm so in love with you that it's maddening. 

I don't know what I've done to deserve you. I don't know what I did to deserve meeting you, at a time in my life before everything hit the point of no return. Albeit a coincidence, a great deity, or destiny, I found you. I'll let it be. I won't use more silly definitions, comparisons, and long rants. I've found you, and that's that. 

I want you to know that I am in love with you. You know it, but I'm reminding you. My whole heart and future belong to you. On this day, one year ago, something awoke in my soul. A part of me came alive, that I think has never existed before. And it's all because of you. 

Thank you for being here. Thank you for being mine. Thank you for finding me. Thank you for loving me the way I've always wanted to be loved. Thank you for showing me the healthy way to love others and myself. 

I used to write to feel what I've always wanted, and now I write to share what I feel. And it is beautiful. It is true. It is meant to be. We are meant to be.

,love,"I am a straight woman and he is a gay male, so regardless, there will always be a barrier. That isn't sad though. I actually love it. Too often friendships are ruined when one or both catch feelings but in this situation, since we don't play for the same team, we can just let the feelings roll with no stress and just be free to feel whatever we feel. 

He's been my best friend for 17 years. I know his entire family and visit them once a month. I know his friends, his previous relationships, literally everything. I've seen him naked, he's seen me naked, we've also sent nudes to each other, slept in the same bed, everything. He's seen me completely wasted, higher than I ever should have been, he's seen me bawl my eyes out and be a disgusting mess on the floor, but he's also seen me so happy. He's been there through it all. Seen my worst and my best, and he still loves me. That is special. 

He recently broke up with his long term boyfriend and it has brought us even closer. During one of my visits we were just talking and being open about how happy we were that I'm there and regularly take the time to visit despite living 2.5 hours away and stuff. It felt like every single thing we had to say led back to one major point, which was that we are in love. I remember at one point I was talking, saying how grateful I was for him, and I started smiling because it was at the moment I realised I was in love, and the same thing happened for him. Hell, we've already been saying we love each other for years anyway so nothing changes by this realisation, but it was just a really precious moment. I wish it would have been filmed somehow so I could go back and relive how wholesome that moment was lol. 

I'm just so blessed to have him in my life. He's also incredibly good looking too so if he wasn't gay, I would have 100% tried to make a move and ruined things and perhaps even have felt envious of other women, who knows. But here we are, and none of that is a concern. Just two people with an immense amount of pure, unconditional love. :)

It's not sad that we will never get together. The love we share is so pure and beautiful. If you saw our texts, you'd think we were a couple anyway. I've had potential partners try to tell me that I can't talk to him, but that will never fly with me. I know we are unconventionally close but my future partner will need to be able to accept that. There is a ton of love between us and we are very close but at the end of the day, we are just FRIENDS with a long history and nothing to be intimidated about. 

I'd take this unconditional love with my friend over conditional love from a partner any day of the week. I feel like I found the type of love that everyone always wishes they could find and I am so lucky to have found it. He is definitely the type I could call at 3am, dead of night, crying, and even if he had work at 8am the next day, I know he'd do whatever he could to assist me in that moment. It's beautiful to feel so *sure* of something. :)",t2_2egf3gmc,False,,0,False,"I found the purest form of love, but we will never be together.",[],r/love,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_lxxa7y,False,light,0.95,,public,16,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},gushing,False,16,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1614925942.0,text,6,,,text,self.love,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a straight woman and he is a gay male, so regardless, there will always be a barrier.

,love,"For context, I work at a coffee shop inside a hospital so most of our customers are regulars who come everyday. About two months ago this guy came in and I was immediately interested in him which is weird for me because usually it takes time. He seemed awkward and quiet. He still is. I would try to start conversations with him while making his drink or taking his order but it was hard because I know nothing about him. One day he noticed my debit card on my lanyard, my card has a card cover on it that looks like a hunter license from HxH. That was how I found out we both like anime. Every time he comes in now we talk about anime and we're both watching Jujutsu Kaisen so we ask for thoughts on the new episode etc. For two months I've just been calling him the coffee guy while not knowing his name or what he even does in the hospital. I've been trying to stretch conversations and make the short time there last. He talks more now. He's not as awkward as two months ago. Definitely still there though.

For most of the two months after I hand him his coffee he says thank you, bye and leaves. Last week I told him ""see you Monday"" he said ""see you"". This week he's begun to linger even after I hand him his coffee, even after he sees that I'm busy making other orders, he lingers and still wants to talk. I assume anyway lol.

Today the first thing I said to him after hello was ""whats your name?"" He told me. He asked my name. My name is weird and has connections to nerd stuff so we started talking about conventions and a famous voice actor who's autograph I have. I like that now coffee guy has a name.

Next time I see him I want to ask what his job is.

It's insane though how after three years of not crushing on anyone I found someone to like in the middle of a pandemic, in a hospital's basement coffee shop, not even knowing what the bottom half of his face looks like. Attraction is weird.

,love,"I have been married for a short time. Will be 4 years in April. I have been head over heads for my husband for 2 of those years until I got pregnant. 

I first got pregnant with our first child in may of 2018. My pregnancy was horrible. Had all the bad side effects, nausea the whole 9 months and crippling depression and anxiety. I started taking anti depressants in my 4th month of pregnancy and have been on them through the whole pregnancy, the birth, postpartum and as well straight into my 2nd pregnancy, also horrible and when my son was only 5 months. Our second child is 11 months old and I have been tapering off of my meds last month. 

Tapering has been horrible. It’s like a horrific never ending hangover. 

The upside is i am feeling all my feelings again. The bad and the good. Now that I’ve been tapering off I’ve noticed that my meds were making me zombie like and I wasn’t “me”. I’m a very emotional person. I feel very deeply, and I last night I felt like that again. At 3 am I woke up from a weird dream and cuddled my husband because i was very upset we went to bed mad at each other. He woke up and we started to get very intimate and made love. It has been a while and we have had sex maybe 4 times in the last 6 months. But last night was different. It was emotional and loving and what I remember it used to be. Then after I cried like a baby and my husband held me as I cried and we feel asleep. 

I forgot how deeply I love him. He means the world to me and I just wanted to let someone know (other than him).

,love,"Yesterday when I woke up, I had an experience where I was almost moved to tears, I just really feel like sharing with everyone. I was in the middle of a dream, listening to a song and driving around, I think the song was Halo by Beyonce. I woke up, and I swear the song was still playing, it didn't feel like it was in my head, it was like I could hear it playing on a radio, and I just felt a million emotions all at once.
I felt so happy and sad at the same time, I was angry and afraid but also excited and inspired, I just felt so much intense love, it was almost likesome sort of supernatural experience. I'm not part of any religion, but I'm a spiritual person, I believe in a higher power, in Heaven, angels, fate, miracles, true love, the whole lot of it, I think its all real, and yesterdsy I felt so much intense love for a girl I've never even met yet.
As of now, I've never had a girlfriend. I've never kissed a girl of said I love you to anyone outside my family, im only 16 anyway, but at that moment, it was like I could feel her love. I could feel she was close, and for a second, it was like I could even see flashes of her in my mind. I know it'll be a while before we meet, I've been saving to leave my country (Ireland) to go live with my family in Western New York, I know that, given the state of the US now, and that I'm only 16, its probably best to wait a while anyway, but I remember feeling this girls love for me, and my love for her, eve  if we haven't actually met yet, it was so intense and ill admit I couldn't make sense of it first, I didn't have a great day when I got up, I ended up arguing with my parents all day, but when I took the time to look back on the experience, I realised there was nothing to be afraid of.
I spent hours trying to make sense of what had happened. I remember thinking ""I have to find her"" ""I have to find this girl"" over and over and over again, first in my head and then out loud. I'm gonna follow my heart, im gonna go wherever love takes me and I'd travel the world over to find this girl if I have to. I can feel she's close, maybe not in time or distance, but in my heart. If you've made it this far, thank you for reading. Apologies it was so long, I just felt like I need to get it off my chest. I encourage everyone here to follow their heart. I know there might be a long way to go before I do find love, but I know I will one day, I think we all will. I encourage everyone here to pursue love, if you already have a partner or a spouse, tell them that you love them.

,love,"“No no no. Please no” was all I could think when my teacher Ms. Roper sat me next to a boy that I would never forget  ✨ Milo ✨

I met my boyfriend in the 2nd grade. Milo was very popular and was friends with everyone in class. Everyone knew his name and in 2nd grade, I was the shy and quiet girl. My friends consisted of kids I would play marbles with on the dirt. I remember thinking that boy was so cute and he would never notice me. At this time he would get in trouble a lot by teachers and hung around with bad kids. Not me. I would do my homework the day I got it and never dare disobey or break any rules. I was basically a teachers pet which I didn’t realize until I thought about this story.

One day, my teacher decided we were going to rearrange the seats but we would be allowed to choose our own seats. I choose a table very close to the white board but also very close to the teachers desk, I has put my stuff there while the teacher walked around marking on her clipboard where everyone else choose their seat. When she came to me, she basically told me I  couldn’t sit there because that’s where “bad kids” who don’t behave sit to make sure she can keep her eye on them. Then she looked around to all the empty seats, and choose a seat for me. “You can sit there, next to milo” my heart dropped. “No no no, please no” I thought as I walked with her and my backpack to sit at the little desk next to my biggest crush. Throughout the week he would get in trouble by the teacher or talk to his friends behind him. I found it attractive that he was labeled a “bad kid”. I loved it. I still love the idea opposites attract. He doesn’t follow rules, i have to follow rules. He didn’t care what others thought of him, and others opinions of me ruled my life. I loved the idea of him and I.

I told all my friends about this and how I would marry this boy one day. He was perfect, everything I could ever want as a 8 year old😂

In the summer of 4th grade, my parents lost their house and we had to move away. I told my closest friend at the time to tell him that I liked him. ( a moment of why not) in my mind, if he didn’t like me, atleast he would know. I have moved hundreds of miles away, who cares. If he by chance does, maybe one day we could find our way back together. 

It is now 2021 and my boyfriend Milo and I have been together for almost half a decade. Of course since then we have both changed and grown up together. He finally does his homework and listens to rules. 

We live together now and are planning our wedding.

Wholesome is so much better!

I would love this opportunity to place my thoughts into cyberspace, it's a long read, however, I'll attempt to keep the details at a minimum and I thank you in advance if you make it to the end. I'm (M) 49, I have struggled my entire life to have and/or maintain a good relationship with anyone. I've lived with a psychopathy my entire life and psychological issues since (11) years old, the path of calamity in my wake is unfortunate, certainly not intentional. In my experience, all the women I've ever dated didn't want anything to do with me once they learned I had mental issues. I dated a doctor, we went out and had lots of fun, I made dinner at my apartment and we had a really good time. I hoped she might get to know me and maybe be compassionate enough to see me as more than a mental case. If I tell a potential date and be open and honest our conversations come to a complete halt. The doctor met me at the mall and stated she only wanted to be friends, she acted as if I was some kind of psychopath and didn't even want me to escort her to her car. I'm very timid, non controversial, I love being a gentleman, needless to say I was extremely hurt and cried, became depressed, I've never hurt anyone in my life. 

I started looking overseas, met a wonderful, intelligent, and beautiful Filipina just two years younger than me. We started chatting online, I emailed her all the details of my life and explained if she wasn't willing to accept me for who I am, then please don't write me back. Three years later and she is my fiancee, she is so sweet and caring, she actually manages me. She is a university teacher and has her life together, I'm moving there as soon as possible. I came back from the Philippines in December 2019, then the pandemic, travel restrictions, I'm literally half a world away, I know she loves me, I've never felt this in my entire life and it has been therapeutic to such a degree that I finally have a positive outlook on life. We have never had an argument, I'm very submissive to her, she treats me with compassion, she understands the human condition. 

I told her one day I loved her, about two months in, every since that day I haven't missed a day in telling her;

""Have I told you today that you're the most beautiful girl in the world and I love you very much "" it's like my prayer to her.

I take pictures of flowers and send them to her, virtual bouquets, we talk every day, video chat for hours all the time. She knows more about me than my psychiatrist and psychologist, she still loves me. She took classes, introduction to mental health, she wants to understand me, she really loves me, she isn't afraid of me, I can read her expression, her smile, her eyes, she keeps me grounded whether in person or virtually.  She is where my home is and I'm going home as soon as possible. 

I pay hommage to her every day, I tell her how I feel everyday, she believes she is beautiful and loved, she is emotionally intelligent and supportive and I love to spoil her, she doesn't expect it, she is humble, she lives in a beautiful place and wants me there, I cant wait. She wants to take me by the hand and make me her own. She has never asked me for anything except my heart. It is truly better than any medication I've ever taken. Being loved is the greatest feeling in the world, I wish and hope everyone in the world could have these feelings. I'm not mad at the rejection I've recieved, I just wish people could get to know each other before passing judgment on who they are.

Things my husband did on his day off, literally the day after his birthday:

-hold my hair back while i got sick
-clean the sick out of the sink, when I couldn't make it to the toilet 
-clean urine out of the bathroom floor, when I got so violently ill i lost bladder control 
-clean me, when i couldn't do it myself, including holding the tissue while i blew my nose
- clean sick out of the trashcan

He did all that while constantly bringing me fresh ice packs, cooking, working with our digital learner, taking the dog out, etc.

Not once did he complain. Not once did he try to make me feel guilty about anything. He did, however, constantly pray over me.

,love,"First and foremost hey everybody. I'm 48 and have been divorced now for 11 years which was my last real relationship. I have spent most of my time the last 6 years or so focusing on my growth. Doing a lot of self analyzing and figuring out who I was before thinking of looking for a romantic relationship. 

I do believe for the first time, in my life, I believe I am actually falling in love with someone. The actual person not a body that would fulfill A to Z requirements on what I was taught to look for in a husband by my parents. Which first falsity was that I was only to look for a man. I made a conscious choice to look for the being, not the gender. To quote a favorite song, ""my love is gender free"". 

He happens to be a man who worked with my brother a few years ago. I have run across him from time to time at Superbowl parties, work parties and, in November last year, at my brother's wedding. We spent most of the evening together, even snuck off to gander at the constellations at one point. I stepped out of my comfort zone and asked my brother to make sure if it was ok if I got his number. We have kept in touch off and on since then.

Two Fridays ago, I had to go comfort my daughter during a crisis. We had to put down our family pet she took with her when she left home. I was heartbroken and found myself sitting in the parking lot at the vet unable to drive...just stuck. I messaged O and he offered to take off from work early if I needed a friend. I accepted. 

Long story shorter, I cannot believe just how amazing and right it feels. Every reaction I thought I would have, like him calling me girlfriend before we even established it, has felt ...well nothing bad. As an empath, my emotions and those of others can be quite overwhelming especially the negative ones. As a fiercely independent woman, I have been quite firm at taking my time and being sure. But with O, I do not feel one single solitary hint of negative ANYTHING. We sit and talk about EVERYTHING for hours upon hours. I can just be me. No hiding. No filtering. No worrying....JUST BEING. 

Neither of us have ever felt like we have ever been able to truly show who we are without ridicule or judgment. I am super stoked and so very incredibly tickled to have found this. With the long time in between relationships and this being his first at 43, we both appreciate the way our puzzle pieces are congruent, as he joked.

So I wrote my letter, but I'm not a very good friend of social network. Also I'm pretty shy about it. So my friends are not in the confidence.

For context I have a heavy sexualized past, I was groomed so many times (online) that I don't remember most of it. I sexualized myself heavily, still do sometimes. Met the love of my life, my first ""healthy"" relationship. We hit it off, I was near ending my life, so was he, we got together (long distance) and talked about sex very much because I oversexualized myself on the daily basis. I told him about all these things I wanted and wished for (sexually). So on my birthday we saw each other the first time and we were kind of sexual already there, which wasn't too bad at the moment until I had one of my first sexual experiences (bj) outside on the ""first date"". I somewhat intended that I wanted it but I realized that was way too fast. Well I didn't learn from that, he went back home we didn't talk about it bc I never mentioned it until like a month back or so. Then we didn't see each other for a few months (7 I think) because of the pandemic, I was still hypersexual and sexualizing myself very heavily. So we planned to meet up and he told me multiple times we'll take it slow and in the pace I want it. He would never want to hurt me and he was sexually assaulted himself so he was really careful but since I oversexualized myself so much and him being very insecure he felt obligated to initiate these things and over the few days he was here we did things that I didn't like. Those were my first experiences and it all went way too fast, I didn't really say anything because I couldn't I felt like my mouth was sewn shut. And he noticed my discomfort sometimes and stopped and I cried snd stuff like that but I still intiated it like a day after and stuff like that. Afterwards I felt very used and disgusted with myself. I don't feel comfortable with sexuality anymore and I don't trust him anymore. This has caused many problems over the past few weeks. We talked about it and he said it was never because he wanted that but rather because he thought I wanted it and didn't want to lose me or disappoint me. But now I lost every trust in him and I feel extremely uncomfortable with sexuality I don't know what to do anymore it just feels like it ruined my life.
What do I do? I don't want to break up with him, he's the person I want to be with for the rest of my life and don't have a will to live without him.

Those were my first experiences and it all went way too fast, I didn&amp;#39;t really say anything because I couldn&amp;#39;t I felt like my mouth was sewn shut. And he noticed my discomfort sometimes and stopped and I cried snd stuff like that but I still intiated it like a day after and stuff like that. Afterwards I felt very used and disgusted with myself. I don&amp;#39;t feel comfortable with sexuality anymore and I don&amp;#39;t trust him anymore. This has caused many problems over the past few weeks. We talked about it and he said it was never because he wanted that but rather because he thought I wanted it and didn&amp;#39;t want to lose me or disappoint me. But now I lost every trust in him and I feel extremely uncomfortable with sexuality I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore it just feels like it ruined my life.
What do I do? I don&amp;#39;t want to break up with him, he&amp;#39;s the person I want to be with for the rest of my life and don&amp;#39;t have a will to live without him. He&amp;#39;s not really at fault, it&amp;#39;s more likely the people who made me oversexualize myself like this from my past but I still feel very hostile towards him and don&amp;#39;t have trust in him.&lt;/p&gt;

,love,"I can confidently say I've been in an amazing journey this past year, even through this crazy pandemic and the not so great moments.

But that's what life is about, having the ups and the downs. 

Last year, in March, well to be exact, March 30th,  I started to secretly date my best friend, Mito. It was scary, I mean I never thought I would have a chance with him in 10th grade, but in junior year we reconnected. That immediate spark we had the moment we met each other again, the texting late nights, walking together, getting to know each other as the weirdos we are, I loved it.

Unfortunately everyone knows the pandemic started in March, everything in the world seemed wrong. I, as many other people have felt, was lost. But I had something that shed a light into my life and that was my Mito. 

The reason we had dated secretly for four months was because of my strict parents, plus they didn't let me see you due to the scare of the virus. But calling and keeping our communication open, bonding truly as a couple. It has honestly...changed my life. Then finally going on dates and being official, touching and kissing you, I felt whole and like I finally understood what life is about. 

I uh.. I made some mistakes in our relationship, I haven't been the best recently. And I really am sorry about it. I regret not keeping our communication open, and im sure to this community, they know the key to a good relationship is communication, even if its a hard thing to say. I'm insecure, as you know, and there's no excuse that I'm going to put for being insecure, just that I haven't learned how to self love, but gosh dammit, I do know how to love when I'm with you. 

Loving you has brought me a sense into myself that I haven't ever had before. With you I feel like I can take on the world. You've been a perfect boyfriend and the bestest friend of mine. I really don't know how I would've made it through this year without you bubba. 

But I do hope, everyday I hope, that we will move in together, experience college, go on that roadtrip we planned long ago, get married, and start a family. 

Maybe I'm watching too many romcom movies, but honestly it just makes me appreciate you and adore you, I see us growing old and having those memorable experiences.

I love you bubba

,love,"I’ve been thinking a lot about you, about us. Before falling asleep last night I just laid there with my eyes closed picturing building a home with you, building what I could with my bare hands for you, having our garden, and being able to just come up to you and give the biggest hug from behind for no reason at all. I want to live with you, be able for us to come home to one another after a long day, have chill movie nights and just cuddle on the couch, random funny pillow/tickle/wrestling/prank fights, planes adventures, hell even random ones. Laugh uncontrollably(me) and just enjoy every little moment with you.

After my last relationship I wasn’t sure I wanted to settle down again, much less picture the potential of even getting married again. But you’ve changed that, you’ve made me see that again. You’ve made me see of how marriage is supposed to unfold and blossom, not for it to be because of a certain reason, but when the time is right. I’m not meaning this in a quick manner, it’s just the fact of I can actually picture it again. Sometimes I wish I could’ve met you sooner but then I think on it, there’s a reason why. We weren’t ready for another yet, we both had to go down our own paths and experience love, pain, interests, and what we wanted. As random as it was that we met, I find it hard to believe it was random, it was laid in our path a long time ago just neither one of us knew it.

I knew I pictured you a long time ago, I just didn’t believe you were actually real. I imagined every detail about you from your eyes, your hair, you height, your looks, your personality, you simplicity, your interests, your little strut with your ponytail, the way we click, the time we enjoy together ... Everything... I only thought that was just a dream, just a figment of my imagination... Yet you were real, you are real, you’re the woman that stands beside me now... You’re something I still find hard to believe that I have...

It doesn’t matter how many times I see you, you “present” yourself to me, it never gets old. You still grab my attention regardless. 

I’m ready for that next step, I’m ready to live with you, I’m ready to start a life with you, I’m ready... I’m ready to build a home with you... I’m ready babes, I’m ready for everything there is in life, with you!

I love you",t2_5pq8djsp,False,,0,False,You,[],r/love,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_lw85r2,False,light,0.94,,public,35,2,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},to my love,False,35,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1614736488.0,text,6,,,text,self.love,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking a lot about you, about us. Before falling asleep last night I just laid there with my eyes closed picturing building a home with you, building what I could with my bare hands for you, having our garden, and being able to just come up to you and give the biggest hug from behind for no reason at all. I want to live with you, be able for us to come home to one another after a long day, have chill movie nights and just cuddle on the couch, random funny pillow/tickle/wrestling/prank fights, planes adventures, hell even random ones. Laugh uncontrollably(me) and just enjoy every little moment with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my last relationship I wasn’t sure I wanted to settle down again, much less picture the potential of even getting married again. But you’ve changed that, you’ve made me see that again. You’ve made me see of how marriage is supposed to unfold and blossom, not for it to be because of a certain reason, but when the time is right. I’m not meaning this in a quick manner, it’s just the fact of I can actually picture it again. Sometimes I wish I could’ve met you sooner but then I think on it, there’s a reason why. We weren’t ready for another yet, we both had to go down our own paths and experience love, pain, interests, and what we wanted. As random as it was that we met, I find it hard to believe it was random, it was laid in our path a long time ago just neither one of us knew it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I pictured you a long time ago, I just didn’t believe you were actually real. I imagined every detail about you from your eyes, your hair, you height, your looks, your personality, you simplicity, your interests, your little strut with your ponytail, the way we click, the time we enjoy together ... Everything... I only thought that was just a dream, just a figment of my imagination... Yet you were real, you are real, you’re the woman that stands beside me now... You’re something I still find hard to believe that I have...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter how many times I see you, you “present” yourself to me, it never gets old. You still grab my attention regardless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m ready for that next step, I’m ready to live with you, I’m ready to start a life with you, I’m ready... I’m ready to build a home with you... I’m ready babes, I’m ready for everything there is in life, with you!&lt;/p&gt;

I love how shamelessly passionate he is for his interests, how he doesn’t care what people think of him in the best of ways, and his own humble admittance to his shortcomings.

To him, I’m just an object, someone to keep a streak going with for routine sake and to meet up with after midnight every once in a good while for a good time. I’m a last resort, nothing but a brief relevance of boredom. I doubt he barely even considers me a friend anymore. I know all this, but it hasn’t been able to stop what I’m experiencing.

He’ll come back with a simple smile, another request for a second chance, and I’ll grant it at a heartbeat. No matter how much I’m stood up, ghosted, or made fun of, I’ll always say yes to him.

,love,"I met my boyfriend on tinder a few months ago and we’re together for nearly six months.
We wanted to take things slow, especially since I mostly have friends that are really toxic towards their partner. 
When I’m getting my period I’m in extreme pain. Because of a lot of negative stress the last two months I had the most painful cramps I had in a long time. 
I curled up to a ball, trying to hide my pain from him when he hugged me from behind. 
When I’m on my period I’m feeling so worthless and ugly and it’s hard for me to believe that someone could like me, let’s not talk about loving me. 
And when I was just trying to breathe my pain away, he hugged me from behind and whispered that he loves me. 
It was so special because I believed him immediately. I just knew that he loves me for who I am, even when I’m feeling unloveable and not worth his love. I love this guy. He’s making me a better person.

Edit: I never thought this would blow up. I just wanted to share an incredible special moment. It was so special because in this moment I realized that he truly loves me. I always thought I wasn’t able to love and to be loved because of my mental health issues and to realize that I CAN love and accept being loved was so incredible that I needed to share this. 

Thanks to all kind strangers for the awards and for your kind words! Maybe I should think about telling my boyfriend about this post.

,love,"Long post, so sorry in advance.

I'll start by saying that overall my wife and I have a very strong relationship.  Together 14 years, married 8.  We have each other pretty well figured out.  But just looking for some tips.  This isn't a ""trying to save my marriage"" type post.  Just a way to make things even better type post.

We both have very different ways of showing affection, and how we like to be shown affection.  I'm very much a touchy, kissy guy.  Have always liked when women are touching me.  Have their hand around my arm, head on my shoulder, sit on my lap for no reason, that kind of stuff.  My wife isn't as much that way.  She had some sexual trauma before we met in college, and even though she won't admit it, I'm sure it changed her some.  She doesn't like to ""make out"", will hold my hand, but thats about it.  Affection to her is showing others that I love her.  Making a mushy facebook post, or buying flowers for no reason, putting a snapchat on my story with a cute picture of her and saying how much I love her.  Things like that, which I do frequently and I know she appreciates.

We get along great overall, laugh at the same things, like the same shows, support each others hobbies, enjoy spending time together etc.  But I just wish we could both give each other the type of love we want, more often.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll start by saying that overall my wife and I have a very strong relationship.  Together 14 years, married 8.  We have each other pretty well figured out.  But just looking for some tips.  This isn&amp;#39;t a &amp;quot;trying to save my marriage&amp;quot; type post.  Just a way to make things even better type post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both have very different ways of showing affection, and how we like to be shown affection.  I&amp;#39;m very much a touchy, kissy guy.  Have always liked when women are touching me.  Have their hand around my arm, head on my shoulder, sit on my lap for no reason, that kind of stuff.  My wife isn&amp;#39;t as much that way.  She had some sexual trauma before we met in college, and even though she won&amp;#39;t admit it, I&amp;#39;m sure it changed her some.  She doesn&amp;#39;t like to &amp;quot;make out&amp;quot;, will hold my hand, but thats about it.  Affection to her is showing others that I love her.  Making a mushy facebook post, or buying flowers for no reason, putting a snapchat on my story with a cute picture of her and saying how much I love her.  Things like that, which I do frequently and I know she appreciates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get along great overall, laugh at the same things, like the same shows, support each others hobbies, enjoy spending time together etc.  But I just wish we could both give each other the type of love we want, more often.  I do the things she likes, but she&amp;#39;s still just not very physically affectionate to me.  She&amp;#39;d rather sit by herself on the couch, than lean up against me or cuddle.  She&amp;#39;d rather sit across from me at a restaurant than next to me.  How do we compromise without making it feel forced?

,love,"Me and my ex broke up about 7 months ago but not a day has gone past where I don’t think about how she’s been doing. I still love her with all my heart and I feel lost without her.

I finally reached out to her for the first time in 3 months on her birthday (Feb 25th) and she basically admitted to me that she was waiting for my message all day. I feel like she was waiting for some reassurance from me this whole time after 3 months of no contact. We continued to have some casual, lighthearted convo, bringing up positive memories, for the rest of the day. It was a pleasant surprise when she popped up to me a day after saying “Well done!” after I posted getting a first for my uni assignment. We then proceeded to have another really good conversation but I made sure to end it after about 3 hours because I understand that most girls need time and space in order to heal from a breakup. Then, over the next few days, I started to see signs that she might be interested in reconciliation and might possibly want me to reach out again. For example, she’s been watching all my Snapchat stories in under 2 mins and she never even used to watch my stories at all before her birthday. But, this morning, she watched my story and then posted a black screen on her story where she said “Never felt this way ever! I hate that I got myself into this position.” I could sense that it was an indirect towards me and she deleted it not long after. A few hours later, I see that she’s posted something about being depressed on her story and I check her Twitter and see that she’s liked tweets like “Hard pill to swallow... sometimes the person you want doesn’t deserve you” and “This time, love yourself more”. I feel like she’s mad at me now and I’m not sure what I’ve done for her to feel this way. She seemed like she really appreciated our interactions so it’s just left me really confused.

,love,"So I’m not normally a believer in tarot or crystals or astrology, I usually take it all with a grain of salt. I think it’s fun, but I’m just a bit doubtful, I always have been. But in the last month a bunch of tarot readings have been popping up for me on my fyp on TikTok. At first I really didn’t think much of it, except then I started to notice that I was seeing them very frequently, and that they all boiled down to essentially the same message; my soul mate was on their way, they are someone from my past, and something big was coming in March. 

Well a few days ago one of my best friends from a few years ago messaged me out of the blue. We FaceTimed for a little while and it was like nothing changed between us even though we haven’t talked in ages let alone seen each other. We live probably 6-7 hours apart now and I haven’t see him since I was visiting my home town before the pandemic. 

Now I always knew he had a little thing for me, and truthfully I felt the same way but nothing ever happened because I was head over heels in love with my boyfriend at the time and he’s two years younger than me. At the time the age difference was apparent and I really liked our friendship. I knew I was moving to another city permanently at the end of that summer anyways. 

The next time I saw him, he was in a relationship and I had settled in my new home in a different town and I was also in a relationship. I felt a pant of sadness hearing he was moving to a new city in the opposite direction from where I was settled and that he was moving with his girlfriend, but due to circumstances I had never truly counted the possibility of something happening between us anyway. 

So anyway we were talking last night and one thing led to another and he confessed his feelings for me. I confessed the same thing and we agreed that neither of us would do long distance and we love each other and even if it’s never romantic between the two of us we’re both ok with that. We had been joking about those dumb marriage pacts that they make in rom coms and came up with our own. In 3 years he’s going to Italy to pursue his masters and if both of us are not in a serious relationship and we still want to see what happens with us I’ll be going with him. 

I am acutely aware of how much can change in 3 years, but I kind of think this could be something real. I think the timing will be right, and I think that if even after all this time there’s still something there, why wouldn’t there be in another few years?

,love,"This is a section of a poem called ""On Love"" by Kahlil Gibran which I took from a talk by Ram Dass. Link at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

When love beckons to you, follow him,  
Though his ways are hard and steep.  
And when his wings enfold you yield to him,

Though the sword hidden among his  
pinions may wound you.  
And when he speaks to you believe in him,

Though his voice may shatter your dreams  
as the north wind lays waste the garden.

For even as love crowns you so shall he  
crucify you.   
Even as he is for your growth  
so is he for your pruning.

Even as he ascends to your height and  
caresses your tenderest branches that quiver  
in the sun,

So shall he descend to your roots and  
shake them in their clinging to the earth.

,love,"“i knew” by lizzy mcalpine always cuts so deep, and has since the first time i listened to it. it truly tells the story of my first love in college. 

“i knew that you loved me when you walked me to class in the dark. i knew that you loved me when you ran to the store for a card.” 

i knew that you loved me after those long deep talks, when it felt like it was just us 2 talking the world away. i knew that you loved me all of those times you waited a few extra minutes to walk me somewhere, every time you told me to be safe, and every time we parted ways. i knew that you loved me when you’d drive out of your way to see me. i knew that you loved me when i saw the excitement in your eyes after reading something i’d written. 

maybe it was combined with the rush and excitement of new experiences all around, but there was something so right and instantaneous in our connection. as the song said, there were so many moments when i just knew. 

“i knew that you loved me, but you told me we just weren’t right. and i knew that i loved you when i couldn’t fall asleep that night.” 

you told me you felt it too, but again, as the song narrated, you said it wasn’t right. 

almost a year later, i still trying to figure out how we could’ve had such perfect moments where we both knew. yet things still didn’t work. i guess what i’ll always be confused on is why do people who know they love each other continue to put each other through hell? why can’t it be simple? in those perfect moments, it’s clear as day.

why do we push away the people we love? why do we run at the slightest connection? why are we so afraid to get everything we’ve always wanted? 

sometimes i want to shake you and say it’s okay! let yourself love. let yourself be happy and free. but i cannot make you ready for something you’re not yet ready to give yourself. 

over time maybe i’ll realize that we truly just weren’t right, even in the little moments when i thought i knew. but every time i replay the song, i’m taken back and left with my questions all over again.",t2_6klqkacn,False,,0,False,i knew that you loved me,[],r/love,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_lv4g6p,False,light,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},quote,False,1,,False,self,1614589680.0,,[],{},,True,,1614618097.0,text,6,,,text,self.love,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;“i knew” by lizzy mcalpine always cuts so deep, and has since the first time i listened to it. it truly tells the story of my first love in college. &lt;/p&gt;

I was ready to take her out back some where and give her the hammer. when she stopped talking and i looked away. She stared at me. I definitely feel a connection was made. but Alas. I was too scared too make a move. but I felt so happy that she decided to talk to me. I definitely would make a move if we ever meet again but all I can do now is dream of that min or so of connection. I love playing situations in my head about her.

You appear and all the emptiness and the weight and the loneliness fade into the black and the distance, they become arbitrary.

I know that in that moment I am loved, and I know when I wake up from this dream, you will be there for me to wrap in my arms.
The feeling I get in this dream is the feeling I hope I can give to you everyday we are together. Sometimes we sway slowly to music, and even when we are just being silly, this overwhelming emotion, a presence almost, fills the gaps between us. It is something that even the word love would not suffice to describe.

,love,"I left my ex boyfriend (we were together for six years) so basically, I left him because there was this really attractive guy who would come to the bar I worked at. We did talk a lot, and I kept thinking we had a connection. This guy was very persistent. My ex even asked a friend (I just found this out) “is she cheating on me?” I wasn’t. 

So we broke up, he begged for me back and I didn’t want him back. Then I started doing fun things with this new guy, within two weeks literally we were sleeping together and saying “I love you” it was so fast...I felt guilt and somewhat regret for leaving my ex. I treated him like shit when I left him. So my current and I basically started the relationship with a lot of sex and we drank all the time. A lot of sex though, and I was basically always having some sort of sexy music on, lingerie, toys, and bondage (things I enjoy) so he was fulfilling all those needs, again I found him very attractive.

Then, while sleeping with the new guy I had to go get things from my exes house and i was basically the one asking for another chance, he simply said no and I only asked this because I heard he was moving onto another girl (mutual friend) okay. So I continued with my current, I realized he was an awesome guy, we did things together and had a lot of fun, and he did thoughtful things. I also did things for him, I would always make sure he had supper ready, or I’d clean, give him body rubs, did everything I could for him. I was trying to be so good to him. 

I began comparing my relationship with my exes. I just felt such anxiety and regret. I kept telling myself “I am happy” with my new guy, and we “have a connection” but there was so many times him and I would talk, and I noticed we disagreed on so many things...we were talking about marriage and kids this was within two months. We barely knew each other now that I think of it. He seemed totally infatuated by me and vice versa. I always felt a “connection” when having sex, we’d say “I love you” and everything and the sex was great for the most part, but I continued to compare it with sex to my ex and I sometimes would think of my ex and his new SO after and it made me feel so sick and guilty.

So, me and my current moved in and all seemed well. Then, I spiralled out of control with my depression and anxiety. I was binge drinking, being so totally messed up and impulsive. Anyways, my current told me I always talk about my ex and what not, which I did. I wasn’t even realizing it. Then, I told my current (wrote him a giant letter) telling him basically that I love him, but I don’t know if I’m in love. At this time, my ex and I talked back and forth on and off for a few weeks, or I’d go through old photos and cry while my current was sleeping. I kept telling myself I was fine, I was happy and I can love my current completely if I embrace it. I said that every single day. Eventually my anxiety and everything just broke me down. 

I felt like, I was forcing something with my current and I know he loved me but I really fucked this up. I hurt him. Our relationship had moments of hot and cold, within a month we got into a fight, and every fight we got into he tried to leave and id beg him to stay. 

He goes out of town for work a lot, and whenever he left I’d get so anxious and sad and cry because I was alone and when he was gone I’d just try to fill my time basically with friends, etc.  So February was the worst month, we were fine until like February 11th (if you look at my old posts you can see what happened) I would try to tell my current to leave me and all of this, and eventually I pushed him away. I broke down, was admitted to the hospital, etc. He said it was too much and I hurt him and he couldn’t handle it.

So, we took some time apart and he told me that he isn’t in love with me, he told me he loves me but I hurt him and compared him to my ex he said he always felt like second place. Told me to move on, he’s over it and he wants to be friends still and wants to spend time together and what not, but we need to respect boundaries. I basically begged for him back and explained I wasn’t in my right mind and everything.

I am currently away from him doing self care and healing. The first few days we talked normally and I was very casual. Then, he called and said everything he said and that’s when I began to beg. 

But, here is what I am confused about.

1. if I really was “in love” with him like I stated, then why was I always comparing to my ex (in my head) why was I missing my ex? 
2. If the sex was as amazing as I claimed it to be, again why was I comparing it to my ex all the time?
3. Did we really feel a connection or was it just lust and infatuation?
4. I am actually now over my ex but now I’m having a hard time getting over my new ex , is this because I have to go through it alone or the fact that I feel so stupid for hurting him? 
5. I tried to convince myself for months that it wasn’t a rebound, but it fits all the rebound stages. Now I’m trying to convince myself it is a rebound?
6. Do you think if I continue to get better and actively change and we remain friends will his feelings ever return?

I know I hurt him deeply and he says he forgives me he said he doesn’t want to be in a relationship he wants to be alone he said at one time he wanted to marry me but that went away he said I started pushing him away for awhile etc it was very painful 
I expressed to him how sorry I was and admitted to everything telling him that I’m going to keep getting better
All I envision right now is him sleeping with other girls and that’s not in his nature and he said he’s not interested in that 
When him and I talked for awhile I was good then I started begging and he just kept saying please stop it’s over it’s done 
So do we remain friends?

Can someone explain why this hurts so bad? Did I just double my heartbreak from my ex?
If I was really moved on like I said, then why was I so concerned about what my ex was doing?

TL;DR I hurt two good men, now I am living with the consequences. I don’t know if my last relationship was a rebound or the real thing. Doesn’t love just come without question?

Then, I told my current (wrote him a giant letter) telling him basically that I love him, but I don’t know if I’m in love. At this time, my ex and I talked back and forth on and off for a few weeks, or I’d go through old photos and cry while my current was sleeping. I kept telling myself I was fine, I was happy and I can love my current completely if I embrace it. I said that every single day. Eventually my anxiety and everything just broke me down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt like, I was forcing something with my current and I know he loved me but I really fucked this up. I hurt him. Our relationship had moments of hot and cold, within a month we got into a fight, and every fight we got into he tried to leave and id beg him to stay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He goes out of town for work a lot, and whenever he left I’d get so anxious and sad and cry because I was alone and when he was gone I’d just try to fill my time basically with friends, etc.  So February was the worst month, we were fine until like February 11th (if you look at my old posts you can see what happened) I would try to tell my current to leave me and all of this, and eventually I pushed him away. I broke down, was admitted to the hospital, etc. He said it was too much and I hurt him and he couldn’t handle it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we took some time apart and he told me that he isn’t in love with me, he told me he loves me but I hurt him and compared him to my ex he said he always felt like second place. Told me to move on, he’s over it and he wants to be friends still and wants to spend time together and what not, but we need to respect boundaries. I basically begged for him back and explained I wasn’t in my right mind and everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently away from him doing self care and healing. The first few days we talked normally and I was very casual. Then, he called and said everything he said and that’s when I began to beg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, here is what I am confused about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if I really was “in love” with him like I stated, then why was I always comparing to my ex (in my head) why was I missing my ex? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the sex was as amazing as I claimed it to be, again why was I comparing it to my ex all the time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did we really feel a connection or was it just lust and infatuation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am actually now over my ex but now I’m having a hard time getting over my new ex , is this because I have to go through it alone or the fact that I feel so stupid for hurting him? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried to convince myself for months that it wasn’t a rebound, but it fits all the rebound stages. Now I’m trying to convince myself it is a rebound?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you think if I continue to get better and actively change and we remain friends will his feelings ever return?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I hurt him deeply and he says he forgives me he said he doesn’t want to be in a relationship he wants to be alone he said at one time he wanted to marry me but that went away he said I started pushing him away for awhile etc it was very painful 
I expressed to him how sorry I was and admitted to everything telling him that I’m going to keep getting better
All I envision right now is him sleeping with other girls and that’s not in his nature and he said he’s not interested in that 
When him and I talked for awhile I was good then I started begging and he just kept saying please stop it’s over it’s done 
So do we remain friends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can someone explain why this hurts so bad? Did I just double my heartbreak from my ex?
If I was really moved on like I said, then why was I so concerned about what my ex was doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I hurt two good men, now I am living with the consequences. I don’t know if my last relationship was a rebound or the real thing. Doesn’t love just come without question? 
Please don’t be hard on me, I already am aware of my actions and I am working on being better&lt;/p&gt;

,love,"Last year, just before summer started I (19M) confessed to the love of my life (19F), but I picked the absolute worst time. I confessed to her when she was only a week out of a relationship, which in hindsight, was a very bad idea. However, she said she was going back out to find someone else, so being the idiot i am, I confessed a couple days after she said that, afraid I'd love my chance again. She said that she'd need to think it over, because she did once have feelings for me but they have since passed. 

Flash forward a few months of waiting for an answer, I get the feeling she doesn't feel the same. However we constantly flirted and said sweet stuff to each other, even though we weren't going out my feelings were just growing stronger. So eventually I asked again, and I let her know that its okay if she said no, I'm not gonna be awkward and we can still be best friends. As a matter of fact, she said no and apologised, but that was okay. I apologised too, and I thought I was fine with it. 

She went out with an old friend of mine shortly after, but after she got hurt by him more than a few times, (we're obviously no longer friends since I took her side, he was borderline abusive) she broke up with him and hasn't been with anyone since. I haven't been in a relationship in a few years now, just for info. But for a while she has still flirted with me and a friend of mine is sure she has feelings for me, but I don't want to ask again just in case it messes up anything. She flirts, I flirt back, but then she... sorta puts up her guard again. Sometimes we'll have complete heart to hearts, and my feelings get stronger. 

She's still my best friend and we talk constantly, I just have such strong feelings that I want to protect her and cherish her, treat her like a queen and make sure she knows she's safe.

,love,"Hi Reddit, I write this with a very heavy heart it has been a week since the incident

I have been dating my girlfriend for about 6 months now . We were very happy and open in the start but now some instances have occurred i will tell you

So i like dirty talking while sex, I am pretty new in sex so i watched a few sex ed videos on netflix. I was exposed to pretty new stuff which i thought how are these fantasies even possible like people liking weird stuff

Last week we were having sex and in the moment i don't know what happened I called her a slut in between the session, I didn't asked for her consent for dirty talking and stuff but it all happened in the moment, and suddenly she said me to leave.After a day when i was talking to her she said that since i broke her self respect and she puts her self respect on the highest priority so she can't be in the relationship with me, She told me some mean stuff in the moment all in her rage like she deserves a man better than me and no one should cross the line of her self respect. It has been a week and she decided to stay with me but now she say that she wants to be near me but she can't , she fears my presence now and tells me what if i had without her consent in future .I simply said to her the main problem lies that we never discussed what boundaries we have to adhere while having sex. She agreed to that but now she is very cold and we rarely vibe like we used to do before the incident. It was all in the moment and i truly never meant it. She says stuff like who calls her girlfriend a slut and i agree with her at some points that i was wrong.Sometimes she says she wished she was happy in the relationship and these things really hurt me too because i also have put in a lot of effort in the same relationship

please my fellow Reddit friends what to do , I really feel so guilty for what i did and i really don't want her to be sad and heal . she tries to be happy , she pretends she is happy and lighten up moments between us now but she confesses that even if she is smiling she is still sad and all laughing she is doing is to lighten up the mood

,love,"My boyfriend (22) and I (f, 21) met on hinge, back in November 2020. We went from being strangers to talking over the phone for two hours, everyday to video calling for over eight hours everyday. In one of our many conversations, I was taking off my makeup and told him: “you’ve to bring me cotton soaked in oil so that I can take off my makeup when I’m lazy.” This was so long ago that I forgot I even mentioned it.

Yesterday, I was really struggling with period cramps and he did everything he could to get me to feel better. At night we went for a walk and I was feeling slightly better so I did my eye makeup and put on some lipstick.

When we got back home, I went straight to bed while he watched AHS: cult. I was still half asleep when my boyfriend started to dab my eyelids gently with some cotton that had been dipped in oil.

I’m baffled. I cannot believe that someone loves me so much that they care about my skin too! I’m so overwhelmed by this feeling. 

For someone who has never felt any love in all their 21  years of existence, this is sure a lot.

,love,"So I have a huge crush on this girl, but I’m unsure if she feels the same way. I’ll explain some things that gives me hints that she might, but I’m not sure if she just considers me a really good friend. I’d really appreciate honest feedback, especially from girls.

So, to start off this girl I like is a coworker. We both work at a healthcare facility. We have the same schedule every week. During work we talk a lot and it always seems like she’s constantly close by my side and gravitates towards me. We joke around and I feel some kind of flirty vibes between us. We tease each other and call each other names. Sometimes we touch each other playfully. Our co workers joked a couple times and said why don’t you guys just date already And stuff along those lines. Her response is always just a laugh and never verbally says anything. I’m not sure if it’s an awkward laugh or an embarrassed laugh. The thing about that is I question if she is just doing this to pass the time during work? Doing it just for fun? Being super friendly? Does she think of me as a just a really good friend she can feel comfortable with? A decent amount of time she talks about guys she’s been talking to/did talk to and always complains to me about them.

We have only hungout once outside of work. She actually invited me to go bowling. We had a really good time together just me and her. We didn’t kiss. But we hugged 2 or 3 times throughout the night and had lots of laughs.

A few weeks later from bowling, I told her that I’m going on vacation for the week to universal studios and she was interested in coming up for a day to spend time with me. She actually went as far as buying a yearly pass and dropped $400 at the drop of a dime and told me that I should do the same so we can go together often. Her planning ahead like that so far gets me thinking that she intends to stay close to me for an amount of time.

We don’t talk through text everyday, but we talk about 3-4 times a week. Nothing crazy. I throw flirty emojis in there once in a while but I don’t get them back.

In person, I try to be flirty with her and I’m so attracted to her that I find myself staring at her and smiling at her with genuine interest. I guess it’s so obvious that a patient at the facility out of no where when it was just me and her said “why don’t you just ask her to marry her already?” I asked why do you say that with a smirk and she replied, “I see the way you look at her and watch her”. Later that day, the girl I like asked me about it and I was so caught off guard by the question and could feel my face getting red and eventually admitted I couldn’t deny it was true. She was really smiley when she asked me and I could tell she was amused of how flustered I was at the question. This literally happened today.

,love,"Unsure on what love is

Hello, 
I’m 20 years old and I recently broke up with my long time significant other whom I do love, or I think. What is love?? I feel like I’ve loved each person I’ve been serious with differently. But before this last one, they were all toxic. What’s the difference between love and friendship? I keep hearing love is a choice. But isn’t it a feeling? this person makes me happy, i can be myself, they are easy to talk to. they get me. With this person however, they barely were interested in sex with me or be intimate, yet they had done some pretty unloyal things ( not directly cheating physically or having sex). He isn’t masculine, I don’t get butterflies or at least anymore. With my exes- maybe it’s because they were all so toxic and off and on: I always had butterflies. But I’m happy to be with him and to see him. I had doubts in our relationship about if it was right or if my feelings were love but I wasn’t sure if it was relationship ocd. Multiple times I thought of leaving them because they could  just be so unbelievably annoying and immature, we are going but i have a huge issue with how immature and childish they act- instead of treating me romantically like a partner. Is that normal? I had these doubts yet i was always concerned and worried about him leaving ME. I know when men are comfortable they turn into children, but should i be this turned off by it? It’s like 24/7. I’m confused on what love is. I want them here, They are the person I want to tell everything to first. but I don’t get butterflies anymore if that makes sense. It’s like it’s all too easy almost.... I’m confused on if we’re friends or not or more then that. They don’t call me “ babe” or “baby” or anything romantic like that, they just call me these pet names/ nicknames. I just don’t exactly feel like I’m being treated like a girlfriend. I’m okay without them, as i should be. But we talk everyday. it feels like they’re still here if that makes sense, almost like I’m not processing that i left them. It’s like I want them here, but the last time I was with them I couldn’t stand being around them. I’m not sure if it was because of covid and being around each-other too much, or my issues with anxiety, depression and derealization. Am i just comfortable in the relationship? Am I afraid of commitment? I can’t really imagine being with anybody else or dating anybody else.I’m unsure if this is because we are still talking and I haven’t met anybody I’m interested in yet. I still feel committed to them, it’s like I’m not processing that i broke up with them. I can’t get back together with him just to hurt him again.

,love,"My (M23) girlfriend’s (F22) grandfather passed away this week, so I’ve been staying with her for most of the week as her family’s been making plans/arrangements for the funeral which is out of town. I wasn’t able to go because I couldn’t take off work on such short notice and no one could cover my shift, but I stayed with her last night as it was the last night we’d get to be together for two nights as they were leaving early this morning and won’t be returning back until Saturday afternoon.

This next part needs context, so to sum it up I’ve been in a really bad depression spell for the last, well, basically the whole winter season. Over January I had some med changes as the ones I was on weren’t working properly and it’s been a headache trying to get it adjusted to a place I’d feel comfortable with. My girlfriend knows this and while we’ve struggled with both of our journeys together, she’s always remained supportive and overall just wants me to feel better. The current medication I’m on I started about two months ago as an “as needed” type thing but my doctor recently added it to my daily medications and I’ve been taking it as prescribed for about two weeks.

Well last night before we went to bed and we were both taking our medicine, I couldn’t find mine in my backpack. Frustrated, I dug through it and couldn’t find it anywhere. My girlfriend asked what was wrong and I told her I couldn’t find it, and immediately, without hesitation, she asks, “do you need me to take you home to go get it?”

Now, this was 9:30 at night, she had to be awake at the ass crack of dawn for the road trip, and I live about 5 minutes away from her so it wouldn’t have been a big deal, but after she said it I had one of those “oh my god, I love you” moments. I ended up finding it on her TV stand right after she said it, and I just kind of paused and said “You were really about to take me home to go get it.” almost in disbelief, not that it’s unlike her to do something like that, but because it felt like a way of saying “I love you” without even actually saying it.

I ended up hugging her for about five minutes straight because I was just so awestruck that she would offer to take me home just to get my medication because she knows how important it is for me right now to stay on top of it. She knows how terrible I’ve been feeling and she knows how much I’ve struggled with trying to find the right medication. I would’ve been fine if I wasn’t able to take it for one day, but it’s really important for me right now as I’m still adjusting to it and I’ve been trying to get my moods stabilized. We haven’t always seen eye to eye on these things and we are slowly learning to be open and talk about it, and just the fact that she *offered*, even though she had to get up early in the morning, even though she has so much going on right now, she still *offered* to take me home just so I could make sure I took it before we went to bed.

It was definitely one of those “oh my god, I love you so much” moments that really spoke to me and made me feel so loved and so taken care of.  We’ve been together for a year and a half (2 years in June!) and I love her so much, and hearing her say that just made me love her so much more, if it was even possible.

I just wanted to share that because I really am the luckiest guy in the world and it’s the little things like that that make me feel so loved and so lucky to have someone who would be willing to do something like that, as small as it is, just to make sure I can do what I need to do. I couldn’t stop smiling when I was hugging her and it gave me a feeling that I haven’t felt in quite some time.

Find you someone who’s willing to go the extra mile to make sure your needs are met. Find you someone who loves you enough to even consider taking you home to get your medication even if it’s late and they have to get up early.

I’m so, so incredibly lucky and so thankful for her. I really hit the jackpot with this girl. It’s the little things that matter, folks.

,love,"Hi guys, first time posting on this sub, but really dont know where to ask, so here goes.

I’m currently in a serious relationship (about 3 years going), very happy and about be married in couple months (uncertainty due to COVID-19 restrictions).

One thing that have been plaguing my mind is that, i cant seem to forget about my college crush. Or to be accurate, I cant stop dreaming about her. It was 10 years ago when we met. I was quite close with her, and was in love with her instantly but really too much of a chicken to anything. So nothing really happened. We were in contact (text, fb messenger etc) up until couple of years ago, but its mostly once a year birthing wishing type of thing. 

What’s actually freaking me out was that i’ll keep having dreams about her from time to time. If i were to put a number to it, maybe about once  every six months. The dreams that i was having mostly about us being more romantically involved or something along that line. What’s strange about it is that I hardly think about her anymore. But every time i’m having these dreams, the feeling would linger for quite sometime. When these happens, it felt like im crushing on her all over again.

I don’t even know where she is or what she’s doing right now. With the lingering feelings and all, it can be quite a painful or frustrating experience. I’m not very good with words so its quite hard to express my feelings accurately. So yeah, im wondering if anyone ever had these types of experience or is it normal and what you do about it. 

Any sharing would be appreciated. Thanks.

,love,"Hello reddit.  I came out of two long (8 and 2 years) relationships that went horribly wrong and I finally met her. That girl. That girl that took an hour to engrave that bialleti coffee machine (which she gave me for my work place breaks , thinking it was nothing but it was already a great thought that I appreciated so much) with little drawings , messages of love , very nice sketches and funny little quotes. What was once a great and useful present is now a unique piece of art made out of her expressing her love, and I love it so fucking much..

It is so hard to tell her how she makes me feel, how our daily sports session from cycling to hiking with our dogs seem like a routine but feels like an extraordinary thing that we just keep on doing.
That girl that looked at my dog and no questions asked, gave her the same love and treatment that she give hers.
That girl that feels so out of my league, but reminds me regularly how nice I am with her and how much she loves me. Do you think she knows how much it means to me ? I think not. I've spent my last 10 years trying to salvage relations going nowhere getting my self esteem to zero and my heart shattered in pieces so many times. And in six monthes I've felt things and emotions I've never felt or known before. And heard things I didn't think I could .. 

We share so many common points (animal cause, dogs , sports, nature and even video games sessions), she is so beautiful to me and  I am still amazed every time I look at her but her good and positive vibes no matter the situations is the pure magic here. 

I accepted to move in with her because we're both 5mins away from the sea and across the street we have hills and forests. It is one hour away from my workplace and my family and close friends asked me if it was a good decision(I used to live 600m from my workplace). I've always felt happy driving back to that beautiful place getting back to my girl always ready to enjoy life .

,love,"Maybe the question looks strange on the first sight, let me explain it:

I have an ex-gf who is now my friend, a really close one. There's not sexuality between us, just being friends and that's all. There's something in this girl which doesn't let me to stop thinking of her every day, although I know that when we were together (few months) we were always fighting and  trying to change the other person. Even now when we are meeting too often we started to ""hate"" to see each other a bit because we are so different in many ways and fighting all day long. But fighting is normal in every relationship, right? Maybe, but unfortunately we are also  being mean with each other some days.

Next to those things I wrote earlier my biggest problem with her that she has really a lot of issues in her life. She has no future because of the lack of motivation doing **anything**. She stopped her studies completely and has no idea what to do. It's already for a year now. She has also psychologist problems (OCD) and  other health issues as well. She is having a job which pays just enough to staying alive non-healthy foods. I feel sorry to her, because she has a really lovely personality sometimes. Her life sounds like a trainwreck than a life you don't want to be a part of. And yes, you can ask then why don't you support her? Well I tried a LOT, but basically no impact. Not just with me, but other friends and family as well. She basically ignores every possible solutions and doing nothing all day long instead.

I'm not saying I'm a complete and a perfect person right now, never been. But I have finished my studies, have a fairly well paying job and even if I'm not really enjoying what I'm doing right now I'm working on the solution to find me something better while paying attention on my mental and physical health and avoiding being in depression during the pandemic.

I just don't feel myself strong enough to fight for a girl who needs more work I could handle.

But for some reason I'm still thinking about her, although I see no logic doing that, that's why I'm thinking I'm in love with her. When I'm thinking back some good moments with her, especially when she touched my heart It really felt ""I'm at home and happy"". This feeling is really rare to get for me besides my family and my cat.

&lt;p&gt;I have an ex-gf who is now my friend, a really close one. There&amp;#39;s not sexuality between us, just being friends and that&amp;#39;s all. There&amp;#39;s something in this girl which doesn&amp;#39;t let me to stop thinking of her every day, although I know that when we were together (few months) we were always fighting and  trying to change the other person. Even now when we are meeting too often we started to &amp;quot;hate&amp;quot; to see each other a bit because we are so different in many ways and fighting all day long. But fighting is normal in every relationship, right? Maybe, but unfortunately we are also  being mean with each other some days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to those things I wrote earlier my biggest problem with her that she has really a lot of issues in her life. She has no future because of the lack of motivation doing &lt;strong&gt;anything&lt;/strong&gt;. She stopped her studies completely and has no idea what to do. It&amp;#39;s already for a year now. She has also psychologist problems (OCD) and  other health issues as well. She is having a job which pays just enough to staying alive non-healthy foods. I feel sorry to her, because she has a really lovely personality sometimes. Her life sounds like a trainwreck than a life you don&amp;#39;t want to be a part of. And yes, you can ask then why don&amp;#39;t you support her? Well I tried a LOT, but basically no impact. Not just with me, but other friends and family as well. She basically ignores every possible solutions and doing nothing all day long instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying I&amp;#39;m a complete and a perfect person right now, never been.

,love,"We worked in a restaurant together where she was a chef and I worked front of house with wine. The first time we met I was eating in the restaurant, the chefs serve the food and she served one of my courses, I was spellbound, her eyes captivated me and her... Aura made me feel warm and fuzzy. I feel like there was an instant little spark, never quite confirmed this for reasons I will explain.

Fast forward about a month and through my current position in another restaurant I was fortunate enough to hear of a vacancy, had I not already been bewitched I would have applied anyway as the restaurant was well regarded as one of the best in my country. The fact I could see her more often was another feather in the cap. The fact that my boss would be her father was another matter! I am 31 and she is 22, I have never had a relationship with a younger woman, they have always been older. 

I got the job and started work, we were at a very high level so my focus was on the job and not so much the gal, she would come, as far as I was concerned, when the time was right. 

A few months went by, needless to say we developed a great working relationship, frought with a little tension here and there. All was professional. I had suspicions that she was having an under the radar relationship with another chef. 

This was confirmed when the Christmas party came around. Normally I would get a little jealous of another bloke, but I could see he was a bit of a waster and a player and was fairly surprised at how little he bothered me. About 6 more months go by, and whilst she is on holiday with her family, her 'fella' turns up to work makes a few excuses for why he can't continue to work in the restaurant and ups and leaves. 

She returns from her holiday and is understandably upset as she didn't see him for what he was until this point. A few more months go by until we start flirting. Although to a certain extent we always behaved differently around each other, used to catch each others gaze across the restaurant (open kitchen) and used to have some pretty in depth conversations. I was always cautious as Daddy has a bit of a temper and is very protective of his daughter. But whenever he and the rest if the family were not in the restaurant our flirting would increase much to the chagrin of the other employees, 'get a room' 'dyou guys want some space' etc

I consider myself to be quite an old school gentleman, but I've been burned in the past and hesitate nowadays when it comes to biting the bullet. What I did was mention a restaurant I was thinking of booking about an hour and a half away from where we worked. A very good restaurant that I really wanted to visit, and she excitedly said she would love to go as well and pulled up the website. Now this restaurant only takes fully paid pre bookings and she then proceed to pay for the entire meal and wine pairing for a few weeks down the line. Bingo! Not an official date but a 3 - 5 hour dinner with plenty of time and the right atmosphere to bite the aforementioned bullet, and a few courses of world class food!

A few days later I said that whilst it'd be great to grab a train we wouldn't get back, so I said how about we make a day and night of it, I can drive us there in the morning, we'll wander about the town for the day, have dinner in the evening and book somewhere to stay in the evening. She was more than happy with this.

One week before the 'date' her father (my boss) and I had a falling out regarding prearranged annual leave I had informally booked with his wife. I ended up walking out of the restaurant. And neither her or her father spoke to me again. Although I made just as little effort to reach out. 

A year and a half later. Mid covid pandemic, I get contact from one of the members of staff who was also in the family. Next thing I know I'm being offered a job in his new restaurant working once again alongside the love of my life.  Lockdown has postponed reopening of the restaurant but I'll hold a few weeks to see if the dynamic has shifted, if not, then I plan to book the same restaurant and surprise her. And hopefully she feels the same way and it will be the greatest love story ever told! Also hopefully her father doesn't castrate me, I don't think I'd enjoy that.

,love,"I listen to a lot of unconventional music. As a guitarist, I like to explore all sorts of music and be open to new music all the time.

So there's this song called KO KI by an Australian musician named Plini. It's maybe in my top 10 favourite songs.

Every time I showed the song to someone that asked me for new music, they did say it was cool but I could tell they didn't like it enough to wanna listen to it.

There's this part in the song where it gets loud all of a sudden after a piano solo, every single person I showed the song turned down the volume right then and there.

And then I met this girl, this fucking girl I swear, every time I look at her my heart falls apart. I tried to put on the facade of ""serious quiet guy"" today, and she destroyed it just by looking at me and smiling.

I showed her the song and because she's a classically trained pianist, she smiled at me at the piano part.

But it was when it reached the loud part that my knees really went weak:

I had a girlfriend who is the best woman I've ever met and I doubt she'd find someone else equal, pitifully it was a remote relationship (she (F) from central Mexico and I (M) from northern Mexico). 

Anyway she and I are 15 years old and we met because of an ex of mine, she and I had a lot of chemistry but her parents are strict and apparently they wouldn't let her have a boyfriend and I had no idea that I thought her parents were aware but she had to ""clean up"" contacts So her parents wouldn't tell her anything about her conversations with friends or me (she was never anything up in tune I was always very respectful) she told me that she would do that and that she would block me for a day so that her parents wouldn't find out,

 for my part I slept this day and waking up I came across a message that was obviously written with her parents in front , on which we could not be together even though he loved me and continues to love me often blocking me from all social networks Obviously it was her parents and she's not to blame according to a friend in common she was punished for a few days and she told me to possibly find a way to talk to me but in what can happen (it's not 100% safe and chances are I'll have to resign and forget it) it burns me inside that I couldn't even say ""good bye"" to :((

,love,"Hello everyone. It's my first time writing a post here and on Reddit. 
I was wondering if what's happening to me is normal, since it happens to me for the first time.
Have you ever fallen in love and started questioning your fundamental beliefs about what life is all about? Like, for example, if you thought that life is all about your career path and doing everything to get a stable job and be independent
 (I'm really considering myself as a career-oriented person, although my boyfriend does not care that much about career, at least not after this whole thing with the coronavirus. He thinks that life is unpredictable and you shouldn't spend that much of your time worrying about what the future holds for you and if you're going to get a job in your field of education or interest.) 
and when you fall in love with the right person you just feel as if life is not that much about jobs, but love. Of course, I'm not saying literally dropping your hopes and dreams for the life you want for yourself, but you find yourself thinking that if you don't immediately get a job that you love, it wouldn't be that bad, as long as you have the support from your loved one and continue to be happy together and benefitting from the opportunities life throws at you?
Is that what life is all about? Being loved and giving love even if you don't end up in the field that you dreamed of? Does this happen to a lot of people? Or am I just turning really toxic towards mine and his growth?
I sometimes feel like all my life I've been lied to. As if all that went through my head and my parents and teachers told me were not true - that life is all about studying, getting into a good university, then pursuing a career path, hopefully in whatever you studied for.",t2_8vip7fhg,False,,0,False,Have you ever fallen in love and started questioning your fundamental beliefs about what life is all about?,[],r/love,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_lrlrhr,False,light,1.0,,public,16,1,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},question,False,16,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1614225168.0,text,6,,,text,self.love,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone.

It’s weird that when I left you, instead of the word crush, the words soulmate appeared in my mind. I felt it. Yet I don’t understand it. Way we met was unpredictable. Somehow I knew I was going to meet you in that setting. I knew a day before.

,love,"In my (25M) final semester of college, I got a part-time job at a store, and there I met one of the most beautiful girls (22F) I have ever seen. And she wasn't just beautiful on the outside, the more I got to know her, the more I realized how kind, considerate and genuine she was. But I would also overhear her talking to her friends about guys she met on Tinder (she is quite promiscuous lol). So I could never quite gather the courage to ask her out, because in my head, she was way out of my league. I was also at a rough patch in my own life because I had graduated college and was unable to find a job in my field because of Covid-19. We have the same taste in music, have the same kind of social anxiety and VERY similar upbringing. We are both stoners. Her most attractive feature is her tattoos. She has flowers and Grateful Dead lyrics tattooed all over her body. She isn't a perfect person by any means, but she is perfect in my eyes. And she is constantly trying to better herself. She also complements my personality perfectly. I have an engineering degree, so I am an analytical person by nature. She is more of the artistic type, very poetic with a touch of melancholy. If we ever did date, I think we would have been like peanut butter and jelly. During my time at the store, I hung out with her and other friends numerous times.

Fast forward almost a year and a half to the present, I recently enlisted in the military as an engineer officer, and am leaving town soon, never to come back. She is starting college this year, looking to get a degree in Sociology. A few days ago, I asked if she wanted to go out on a hike with me (I love hiking and outdoors). I thought it would be nice to hang out one-on-one for the first and last time lol. And to my surprise, she was super enthusiastic about it. So we spent the day at a nearby nature park, just hiking through the woods and talking about our lives. And I have never been so comfortable around a girl in my life. After the hike, we went for lunch and she bought me fish and chips. I finally dropped her back home, and before saying farewell, I gave her a gift which I had made for her. She hugged me, and I could see tears starting to build up in her eyes. And I was quite frustrated because I could feel tears building up in my eyes too, and I had this big heavy lump in my throat. She hastily said bye and ran into her apartment. She later texted me and apologized for being so bad at goodbyes and said I was one of the kindest people she had ever met and wished me good luck in my career.

So now, I feel confused, frustrated, thankful and happy. Confused and frustrated because I feel like if I had asked her out when I first met her, I think she would have said yes and we would have bonded like super-glue. She would have probably been the best thing that ever happened to me. But then again, I don't know, maybe she just sees me as a good friend. Thankful, because if we had started dating, we would have had to break-up now and I would definitely be shattered. And happy, because I have such an amazing friend.

I hope she does well in life. I hope she is able to chase her dreams and achieve everything she wants to achieve. And I hope our paths cross again somewhere down the road. And if we do ever end up in the same place again, I think that's a sign from the universe, and I'll ask her out right then and there.  :)",t2_9xjvyoev,False,,0,False,A touch of grey kinda suits you anyway.

,love,"I was thinking about it earlier.. I feel like so many men don't experience much love in their lives. It's pretty common for guys to be raised to be tough, don't show emotions, don't do anything ""gay"" that could be shown as ""weak"". These ways of thinking are so outdated yet it's still so prevalent in society.

Throughout my life, I feel like I've noticed a major difference in how compliments or friendliness are shown towards men versus women. Women are often given more attention and shown more love. Where's the love at for men? I feel like men often don't compliment other men because it can be seen as ""gay"". Women might be hesitant to compliment men because they could become clingy towards them. 

This post isn't to be ""pro-men"" or ""anti-women"" or whatever. My point is that I feel like attention women get, men should also get. Just think of how simple it would be to give men compliments more often and how dramatically it could change their day or even lives. It's common for men to deal with depression. Compliments would go a long way for people dealing with self image issues or mental health issues.

I feel like in my experience, it's pretty common too for men to sometimes get clingy with a women if she seems friendly towards them. This seems like a clear indication that if the man becomes clingy from simple friendliness, it's because they don't know what that's like. A woman could say something as simple as ""I like your hair"" and they may go head over heels for her just like that. Why? Probably because he's a bit desperate for affection or some form of love. Doesn't mean he's just desperate but more so, lacking of affection in life. Receiving positive attention from someone can sometimes be a light in the darkness that they live in. Thus, becoming clingy because they want that light to be more than just a light but to overpower the darkness they live in and live in the light. Aka, love?

Uplifting men by doing things such as giving a compliment here and there would greatly effect how men are. 1. mental health issues would more than likely go down a lot more 2. men would be less likely to become clingy to a woman that's friendly to them. Could also potentially lower the rate of crimes against women such as sexual assault, etc.

I'm not making this post to be ""radical"" or side on anything. I was just thinking about stuff today and how I'm honestly jealous of how much better women are treated just for being women compared to myself. Yes, I've dealt with depression. Yes, I rarely get any affection or have in my life. I hardly know what it is. I've had times where a woman might give me a compliment or do something friendly and I know I instantly get the thought in my head that, ""whoa, maybe she likes me? Maybe I like her? Could there be more to this? Could we be a thing??"" As soon as these thoughts pop into my head I shut them out because I refuse to become a clingy person over someone just being nice. I can fairly easily tell when a woman isn't interested in me but just being nice. I just wish I'd have had more affection in my life and even now. It would have made my life so much more different than what it is. I may have even avoided dealing with depression for 10 years.

,love,"One of my best friends got married a little over a year ago. She and her husband seem genuinely perfect for each other (as perfect as imperfect humans can be, of course), and I've always been in awe of how good they are for each other, how they understand one another and work so well together. She recently described a moment where she was watching him, before they had even started dating, and the thought came into her head: ""This is my future."" Like, she knew and she could feel that she was gonna spend the rest of her life with this person.

It's... scaring me a little that I'm kinda starting to feel that sort of thing myself.

This started off ""casual"". I didn't even expect to fall for him as hard as I did. I've been *fantasizing* about being closer with him, being openly in love with him, living with him, having a life with him... But only fantasizing. And only in (attempted) moderation. Always slapping myself on the wrist and reminding myself, ""That's never going to happen. This stays a fantasy."" It wasn't actually difficult or painful, though. I was able to process it all and accept that if things only ever *stayed* casual or ultimately platonic between us, then that would be okay, and I'd still be happy and grateful to have met and known him.

He was honest about his anxiety around commitment right from the start, and his lack of interest in a ""serious"" relationship. But it took months for me to understand what was truly going on in his head. We were communicating openly and with vulnerability throughout it all... but still sheepish, still skirting around the whole truth, sometimes maybe subtly alluding to it.

When I finally admitted to him that I love him, it was only because I simply wanted him to know, and knew that I was safe being honest with him. I made it clear that I didn't expect reciprocation... that I only wanted for him to be aware that he means a lot to me and that I care deeply for him.

With how indescribably intimate everything had felt between us from the very beginning, a part of me thought that there was no way he *wouldn't* reciprocate those feelings... Though a much larger part of me was still certain that that was only wishful thinking.

But then... it ended up *not* being wishful thinking. It was just *reality*. He said he loves me too, and that I was just the one brave enough to admit it first.

And when we finally established how we really felt for one another, then it was like all these barriers suddenly dropped away.

That was over 3 months ago. And everything between us has just been *blossoming* since then.

At first, he was still quite scared, uncomfortable with the actual phrase ""I love you"". I didn't mind. I've never minded; I'm really only interested in empathizing with and accommodating his fear. I see why he's scared (after a string of bad relationships, I'm a little scared now myself), and I see how he faces the fear in a self-aware and healthy way, and god I just love him all the more for it. But the anxiety's been diminishing... And by this point, it feels like we're *miles* from where we were those 3 months ago — and still gaining speed, fast and away.

He now openly tells me that he loves me. He's marked the day we first hung out together in his calendar as our ""anniversary"". We were very physically close and touchy-feely before, but it's somehow *exponentially* more now. We can't keep our hands off one another, can't stop endlessly smiling at each other. We're talking in ridiculous baby voices, more freely calling attention to every little thing we adore about the other. I didn't even realize we'd had so many barriers up before until they were suddenly gone and there was nowhere left for us to move but *closer*.

We're officially monogamous now. He'd been hooking up with a few others since we started seeing each other (which I've been aware of and okay with the whole time), but he just told me recently that he's realized he doesn't want to and *can't* do that anymore. Poor thing described an encounter with one of the other people he'd been seeing where he anxiously blurted out, ""I'm sorry, I love someone else, I can't do this!""

And now, just the other day, during a conversation about each of our dream cars (of which he in particular has many), he told me, ""If we stay together, I'm sorry but wherever we live is gonna need to have a massive garage.""

And that... *that* is what's been playing over and over again in my head.

For him to reference the potential for us to be... really outright *committed* to each other... living together. Pursuing a life together. It's all the things I used to chastise myself for daydreaming about. All the things that I thought would never be reality, that I thought he would never actually want.

And now it only seems that we're *hurdling* in the direction of that very reality.

It's all so easy and good. We each understand one another in exactly the ways we need, take care of and comfort one another, openly and calmly communicate about anything and everything. I've... *never* experienced this before. I've been in a few 2- to 3-year-long relationships, and I never made it even 3 months into any of them without already running up against major issues which ultimately led to the endings of those relationships.

I'm still *stunned* that a relationship which feels this good and easy is even *possible*.

I keep thinking back to my friend and her husband. That relationship that I've been admiring and (quietly, to myself) *envying*. That's... what this feels like. It's like I've stopped even being able to imagine my life without him.

He... he might actually be my future.

It feels simultaneously terrifying and like something so profoundly beautiful that I want to cry and cry and cry tears of joy and love.",t2_3tvbcsb1,False,,0,False,Just gonna talk it all out,[],r/love,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_lr25b6,False,light,0.93,,public,28,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},gushing,False,28,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1614164964.0,text,6,,,text,self.love,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my best friends got married a little over a year ago.

,love,"I wrote you this letter with anticipation with this dinner is where we ending things, that thought has given me anxiety attack throughout last few weeks, and for my own sake’s of closure. 
First of all, I really want you to know I always really want to know how you feel and understand all of you with my whole heart without any judgment. What I should have done is to ask how you like to be in a relationship, instead of letting it slides. Ask yourself if you ever thought about get to know me deeper or try to get to know me before fixing me in a box. That’s my only goal when I walked into this relationship, everything else is bonus. The fact that you think we don’t have enough in common and use that as an excuse has upset me and make me so angry. I rather you simply tell me you don’t love me, instead of finding this lame excuse. I don’t consider myself stupid, nor should you. I rather look for the commonality than the difference. But this is just me…
Honestly, I have not felt I am enough around you. You are always too prefect for me form the start. I am not sure how you become so prefect as a person, but baby sometimes you don’t need to push yourself too hard to be so perfect. Give yourself some space to breathe and be a human to feel a little. You could say I have low self-esteem, maybe I am. I sometimes think I am just an afterthought for you. Maybe I am too needy, but I only wanted it from you. And naturally you should be wanting to talk to me or know how I am doing. In a partnership, you will be there for the partner to get through all the doubts and thoughts. There is never a best timing for a partner to be there. You don’t need to have your life settled, then allow someone to be in. also sometimes confidence can also be given from the partner. But yet, when I said I think I am not as smart as you, you went silence. I take it as you agree, but you didn’t want to say it out loud. Or maybe you are not. But my confidence slides a little each time.  I am not projecting you are a bad person, but.. be sensitive to what others could perceive.
Maybe you are not as sensitive as me, but make sure you pick a logical person. Then they wouldn’t mind. 
I walked into this relationship with expectation of I will be with you forever, never one thought of let’s try this and I might leave you at some point. I might be that person previously, that’s also why I feel more about this situation. That is why it hurts me to know you are just here to have fun and try it on. And ready to leave whenever it’s not convenient or there is a hiccup for you. Because i once was that person and know how hurtful that feel.
I am a person that happy to deal with whatever issue together. In all areas, as long as we talk about it, I know we are both introverts. But it takes courage to admit there is some imperfection in all of us, and I embrace all of it. I hope you will too for the next person you met along the way. 
I am also a person with lots of interest, I likes a lot of things instead what you assume, I don’t like a lot of things. Maybe I never show it and I been thinking why. I think because I was so keen on spending time with you, I rather see what you want to do than just ran off and do my own stuff. Being single for a lot time is not an excuse for making your partner feel alone in the same space.  
After listening to some of the podcast, I also understand all my emotions comes from being neglected as a child, and every time if I sense something similar, it gets to me. And I am sorry about this. i am going to work on it in my life, but I wanted you to be there, sadly that is not going to happen….
Since our last chat / broke up, all i wanted to do is to talk to you. I am constantly swing between I really want to talk to you and I really need to get over him. I just want to make sure you are okay even everyone said you should be the one asking me, or reaching out. But you never did. It hurst me think, i am not even on your mind, until maybe two weeks later, you said “i have been thinking about you”, then I sat there and cried for a while. That’s just all I wanted sometimes, is to know that you are thinking about me. I have been blaming myself for having this much emotion, blaming myself on I am not good enough for you, blaming myself didn’t do enough for us. My mood has been swinging between anger and sad. Angry about not knowing what went wrong along the way, angry about my gut told me something is wrong, but I am too scared to face it. Angry about you didn’t even want to try or try harder. At the same time, I am sad. Sad for i think you don’t love me as much as I hope for, sad that I am not as important to you as I expected. Sad that I could be just an afterthought. Sad that i was not your one in the future. Sad that I didn’t have the courage to told you all my feelings when I had a chance.
I want you to know, a relationship takes two sides to make it work. Yes maybe along the way, you find a better person, smarter person, but I wanted you to know that better person was also once like me, also once like you, not perfect. But his experience makes him grown. it’s a shame that takes a lot learning to be perfect. But A relationship should go through at its worst and it’s best at the same time. It is not a relationship if you only want the best. The worst for relationship is that you have given it up at its worst and without even try the hardest to save it. Being brave is not given up at the time, being brave is to try your hardest to fight for it. We have very different definition of being brave in a relationship Michael long. 
But.. we all believe we can find a better person next time around in this modern age. I once read .. the grass is green not because you left it, because you water it and take care of it. Grass really is not always greener. You can’t compare individual in a relationship sense. Everyone is different, two lives together with two completely different childhood and families. It always going to take some times to fit in each other’s lives , and take compromises and adjustment. 
Essentially, you have been very selfish, I am too. I become super sensitive on what you said,, worry that I not see through that you mean,, and repeat this cycle again. I haven’t given you enough space, all this letter is only me express my feelings, but I don’t know how you feel. But make sure you admit it to yourself. Don’t get me wrong, you are very generous in lots a things, but very selfish and close in emotions. I hope you can be less selfish and think about how to work a relationship together. If you walk into a relationship already thinking about leaving, the partner knows, I look back, I know how much you were withdrawing. No introducing me to the family.,. even I am present,, it also feel like.. you were ready to leave me anytime, so it is not worth introducing. I felt that. I don’t know.. maybe “Oh its too quick” but ask yourself that question. 
You put people in a box and assume what they are, be open and listen to them. Everyone has something we can learn, yes some are more annoying than the others, but there is also a reason behind it. I hope you can find the goods in people instead of drill on their bad. That’s how I felt towards to end, I don’t think you see any part of my good anymore. This is what I meant when I say we think and look at things differently. You look at things where they have faults. But you can’t, because everyone has some reason to be that and you as a friend or partner is to accept them. Maybe you embrace more to your friends, but as your ex, I feel a lot of pressure from you withdrawing from me. Once’s again, confidence could be given by the partner, the more pressure I felt, I more scare for me to do things / say things. Because I don’t want to trigger even more resentment. I hope you understand how introvert works. I needed to be invite to talk, not necessary “hey let’s talk about this” it’s how the environment makes it comfortable to talk. That is part of the reason I can talk more in a smaller setting. 
If you are reading till this part. Thank you very much for the patient. This whole letter has a lot of I in it. And sorry about this. Just needed to let it out. probably is the harshest things I ever say, but please don’t take any offense of it. You are not a bad person at all. But you have so much need to be improve in handling a relationship.

,love,"Essentially I'm advocating for serial monogamy. The idea that people can grow and change as time passes; and while yes some people grow closer, many others grow apart. And if this view becomes openly normalized by the culture we as a society would be spared a lot of heartache.

Edit: there's some confusion I am not making case for polyamory (I have nothing against it I'm just not advocating for it, love is love). I am advocating serial monogamy; multiple romantic partners over time without overlap.

Edit pt.2: whether I intended to or not the question of polyamory came up so I figured I'd throw in my 2 cents. I personally could not do it I just don't know how I could divide my time and affection fairly between more than one person. That being said I know that there are many people who can maintain fulfilling relationships with multiple people. And I think that is just as valid and beautiful as monogamy. As long as it's consensual love is love.

And if this view becomes openly normalized by the culture we as a society would be spared a lot of heartache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: there&amp;#39;s some confusion I am not making case for polyamory (I have nothing against it I&amp;#39;m just not advocating for it, love is love). I am advocating serial monogamy; multiple romantic partners over time without overlap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit pt.2: whether I intended to or not the question of polyamory came up so I figured I&amp;#39;d throw in my 2 cents. I personally could not do it I just don&amp;#39;t know how I could divide my time and affection fairly between more than one person. That being said I know that there are many people who can maintain fulfilling relationships with multiple people. And I think that is just as valid and beautiful as monogamy. As long as it&amp;#39;s consensual love is love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who engaged with this! Weather you agree or disagree I believe the discourse here has been very rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

,love,"Recently finally have given up my fight for the previous love of my life, I believe I still love her and dont want to be with anyone else. However, I have to respect her wishes of letting her go. It is a very very long story but its been hard to come to grips with it because she acted like someone I have seen before but didnt really know towards the end. She still lives with her parents about an hour away and they are old fashion so pandemic was hard to see eachother with the whole quarantine bullshit. Anyways, I just wanted to see her everyday during it and only person I wanted to be spending time with but couldnt so it was very hard. We tried to see eachother though and did a few times with her sneaking out and things like that, I helped her graduate college throuhg her senior year amid covid and celebrated together... things were fine besides occasional arguing over dumb stuff. We have a history of breaking up tho and past issues that she cant forget about which has been difficult, she is very stubborn and hard headed and would def make me feel bad for stuff even tho she was apart of it as well. Anyways, last year on valentines we had our worst fight ever and she broke up with me and walked out basically. It wasnt a normal fight and we both thought it was over, I was so frustrated that night I started messaging girls but immediately regretted it and stopped. I didnt talk to any mutual friends or girls it was just a couple random bitches that dont matter but still I know theres no excuse and was very sorry after our fight we both made up and decided to keep talking bc we are in love and miss eachother. I didnt tell her right away about me messaging girls cuz I justified it with her breaking up with me so I was technically single or whatever and I know she is a hothead so didnt wanna risk losing her. Eventually I just forgot about it after things were good again but during quarantine I was reflecting a lot and decided to think back to it and wanted to tell her. She was furious and broke up with me again and stuff and ever since then wasnt really the same which sucks. We saw eachother a couple more times visitng and staying in touch after that whole thing calmed down. My love for her was so real and gave her everything, for her bday I got her a 2k laptop and a bunch of other customized creative gifts catered to her personality and interests that I had been working on, also a post surgery care package for her mom that had a operation coming up. This was in december, after that she found out I tested positive for covid around same time I braught the gifts to her porch and I was distancing and wearing a mask. She got really mad and blocked me and cut me off again and they didnt end up getting the virus but I didnt know I tested positive until after I braught them either so was just a big miscommunication and obvi just spooked her. Anyways, months pass by and Im still blocked and she continues to be harsh online saying we are done and shes over it and happy and blah blah but ive heard that a million times almost because shes just kinda stubborn and wants the boy to fight for it I think sometimes or something idk. Anyways, I just dont get how after 2 years almost she broke up with me over text and literally acts like she doesnt even care now. After I got her a 2k laptop she didnt even try to reach out or come see me... like not to be materialistic but I thought at least would mean something idk. Now, we dont talk and last time we did was over email cuz blocked everywhere and shes just so harsh and different person online. In person, its way different and shes so sweet and we get along like best friends so naturally. I just hate how turned toxic and know we are both good people, she claims we been broken up since I told her the truth about that one night I messaged other girls on accident but then subtweets about me saying its childish to get gifts back from ur ""SO"" after a breakup when I requested to have laptop back after she continued to tell me we are broken up over text basically now because I am still making payments on it since thats the option/route I went.

,love,"As the title says, I love my fiancée so much. But that’s just an understatement. She’s very attractive (8.5 out of 10), while I’m just a 7 at best. She’s smart and hardworking yet very humble, sweet, kind, compassionate. Her empathy towards others is second to none. You could say that she’s empathetically gifted. She’s also very understanding and patient. She supports no matter how I’m feeling and whatever happens. She’s supported me through my depression as well as my problems with my dysfunctional family. She could listen to me vent over and over again, even about the same stories. That’s how patient and understanding she is. Everytime I get a text from her, I feel moved. My spirits are often lifted. 

She hasn’t allowed becoming a lawyer at a Big firm to turn her into a bitch. Which even now, is still shocking. She’s even more humble than ever. With her attractiveness she has many guys at her firm hitting on her. Some of them even turned against me when they found out that I was dating/engaged to her. They even used things like my job against me. With that in mind, she decided to leave that toxic environment behind and found a job at a better firm, where she’s currently working right now, which the people there have been friendly and accepting of me. The fact that she stood up to her colleagues makes me feel safe with her. 

She makes me wanna do better every day. She had made me a better person overall. Before that I was severely depressed (despite academic and professional success), a bit judgemental, and pretty troubled, without her, suicide would have taken me from this world years ago. I can’t wait for the day we get married. I used to think that she was out of my league. I still do, but that makes me feet even more grateful.

And how much he deserves to laugh and play and he deserves to cry too

,love,"I feel like I see a lot of people on here who like talking a lot about a significant other or a person that they feel that type of love for, and while I'm absolutely sure that they all have amazing, loving, and supportive relationships, I sit here with quite a handful of attempts at finding a relationship like that and can say that I've come to realize a lot.

Yesterday, I went on a date with a girl I've always held in high regards and had a lot of respect for. We had both established with each other a couple weeks ago that we felt similarly for each other, always caring to listen to each other's problems and supporting each other in all of our pursuits. We decided to go on this date with each other to test the waters and see if we could make things work between us, since we had our doubts about our feelings. We ended the date early, since we realized that our doubts were true, and we had confused our close bond as friends for a romantic love.

This was the latest of many attempts I've made at finding a romantic relationship, and I think something really clicked. So many times before, I've objectified and idealized people in my head, and fell in love with an idea of them that I imagined. This went on for a long time, and as I grew older I realized more and more that I have to see the other person for who they actually are than who I want them to be, and accept them for it. And then, in this date, with a girl who I definitely felt something genuine for and definitely felt similarly to me, we came to learn that we confused our feelings for something romantic, fueled by the urge to want something romantic. In truth, we're just really close friends who care for each other a lot, and, while maybe something could work somehow, we're definitely not in that place.

And somehow, I didn't feel horrible about it for once. I actually felt... relieved. Relieved that we both understood our feelings and were willing to continue being friends.

In truth, we don't NEED romance. I've come to realize that over time. I'm a straight guy, and a lot of my friends are girls. I can guarantee that I've at least FANTASIZED a relationship with most of them, but looking at my bond with all of them now I can't really imagine having things any other way than the way they are right now. I'm happy to have friends and family that will stick with me through anything, and I'm happy to be supporting each and every one of them. I love them, and they all love me. It's not romantic or anything. It's just love.

And I think that's all that love is, right? A genuine urge to care for and support another person.

And so, from this point on, I think I won't worry myself too much with trying to find a romance. If somebody else comes along, then maybe I'll give it another shot.

,love,"Many times I thought about posting here, but I felt like “eh, nobody will really care” or “I’m wasting my time I can handle it, no need to vent.” But today, thinking about it now, I can’t hold it in. I need to share this with somebody but I don’t really have anyone to share it with. So I’m gonna post it here, at least to get it off my chest, and well, to share it with like minded people. It’s better for me anyways because you folks will understand me much better than the folks around me. 

I haven’t had a girlfriend in 7 years, since Grade 7. But between then and now, I’ve achieved a lot and started my career at only 20 years old. I can also say that I’m fairly wise for my age, and many times I’ve been told that I’m a “old soul” or that I’m a real “lover”, and well, I can see it,’ I know it. Anyways I wanna share my life with somebody. I just wanna be in love with in a woman who loves me back. A woman who I can he!p grow, nurture, care for. If she’s broken, I wanna he!p heal her wounds. I learned that love isn’t just about being with somebody, and sharing feelings with them, there’s much more to it. I just can’t explain it in a few words unfortunately. But one thing I believe in a relationship you must he!p each other grow. And “grow” I will use as a general statement. Grow can be anything, support that person with their dreams, he!p that person become a better person, heal them. Those kind of things I refer by “he!ping that person grow”, so it isn’t limited, there’s a lot more that I also want to mention, but it’ll be too much to write. Maybe I’m rambling so if you feel I am, I’m sorry. But I just want somebody badly. I have my family whom I love very much, but I know they won’t be here forever, and in a way, part of me feels incomplete because I have no lover. I know if I tried to tell my parents or anybody I know, they’d say “You’re young, don’t worry, focus on your education” or “don’t worry you’re young, soon you’ll find her”. I hate hearing that statement because I feel like love doesn’t have to wait, and it shouldn’t have to wait. Anybody can be in love, or want love, it doesn’t matter what age. Now I’m only 20, but I started my career last year. So for me, it’s work and home, work and home, I don’t go out much. It’s also covid and currently most places are on lockdown. And where I work, being a truck mechanic, there’s no girls my age, so I don’t have much options. Now what I really I hate a lot, is that I’m filled with so much longing, and yet I’m in the worst situation in terms of finding love. I find it difficult to communicate with girls online, like my old highschool lady friends, but if I were to see them in person it’d be much better. Another thing, I feel like girls, and well, people in general like to walk all over me, but in a way, I feel that I’m blessed, regardless of that. Now I’m really hoping that I can meet somebody or that somebody maybe would tell me that their in love with me. I’d love to hear or see those words from somebody. I’m just tired of waiting for so long, and I’d hate to continue waiting for years for love. It drives me crazy, and it’s wearing me out.

,love,"On the last day of freedom I had over my winter break before college applications became the all consuming force they are, I called a long standing friends with benefits and asked him if he wanted to date for the rest of my time in high school. It was an offer prefaced with, ""I don't have any feelings for you"" and ""I know I'm scared"".

I knew I was scared but, I didn't expect to have a panic attack thinking about the possibility of him saying yes. There was no handbook or expectation or need for a deeper intimacy with him. I didn't understand what it would mean to be in a romantic relationship with someone, especially since I don't want one with him. I am more than okay with see where this flimsy possibility goes but, we've been friends for 6 years and physically involved for half that time— it was safe to say I wasn't romantically interested.

My inability to obtain a romantic partner is my biggest insecurity. Do I find it stupid and absolutely pathetic? Yes but, I've been physically involved with five times the amount of people I've been interested in dating so things are starting to pile on. One has a 100% success rate, the other has a 100% rejection rate, and it's not hard to guess which one. The first boy who ever showed me possible mutual romantic interest said, and I quote, ""I'm sorry if I led you on but, I just thought you were hot and I was really horny.""

The second and last boy who's ever showed me mutual romantic interest is why I am writing this right now. Nothing really happened between us but, the first time we met was a first date that lasted five hours. Short story shorter, he reminds me of the first fictional character that ever caught my eye and we have the exact same music taste. Do I have any feelings for him? No, I barely knew him but, the possibility was there and I wasn't going to deny that. I don't know how things can go so wrong so fast and as much as I want for this to work out, my gut says he's gonna ghost me. For once, I just want to be wrong.

I have a very strong personality. I know how I can feel about you so maybe I too much too soon. And maybe it's stupid of me to have him be the one thing that forces me to write about this but, thinking about him was only ever plagued with the thought, ""what if he's lying like the last one?"" Maybe that was my own manifestation of what would happen but, for the first time ever I didn't think about hooking up with him— I just wanted to hold his hand.

There's an over romanticization of a first romance in your teenage years, very forcefully pushing the societal rush/pressure to have first dates or sexual experiences while you're still in high school. All people ever offer for semblance is the same focus on yourself spiel. While I agree, there comes a point in time where it just becomes a cop out answer. I'm young and I have a lot of things to learn but, don't discount how I feel. I'm no longer spiraling like I was two years ago asking what's wrong with me or what have I done wrong. There's nothing wrong with me in terms of having or deserving the affection love or care from my preferred gender.

I know it's completely normal not to have those experiences but, I don't want to hold hands for the first time the same year I start looking for my first apartment. I want him to still be a boy. I want to preserve whatever innocent excitement I might have about this stupidly inefficient action that shows affection. For once I want to be kissed without being felt up or the presumptive agreement of a sex act. But apparently wanting to be kissed for the sake of being kissed is something that's too much to ask for. I feel so pathetic every time I think about it. I'm young but at the same time, I'm running out of time to have whatever idyllic picture perfect teenage romance. In my head it's the only way I can properly prepare myself for a partner in the future. Even though a lot of first or real relationships happen in your twenties, I don't think it'll ever compare to one I might have during this time in my life.

There's just something special about getting together knowing it'll end but, making most of the number of days you do have together. With college acceptances slowly rolling in and the number of guys I'm romantically interested in so few and far between, I don't think the next five months will be enough for me to experience this serendipitous memory so many people affectionately recall. At this point acceptance is the only answer and even if I've know since I was 5 years old, it's the biggest heartbreak I'll ever have to heal from.",t2_1monp2fk,False,,0,False,"Out of fear, I decided to speedrun for a relationship",[],r/love,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_lq4fz9,False,light,0.84,,public,4,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},statement,False,4,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1614068808.0,text,6,,,text,self.love,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the last day of freedom I had over my winter break before college applications became the all consuming force they are, I called a long standing friends with benefits and asked him if he wanted to date for the rest of my time in high school.

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an over romanticization of a first romance in your teenage years, very forcefully pushing the societal rush/pressure to have first dates or sexual experiences while you&amp;#39;re still in high school. All people ever offer for semblance is the same focus on yourself spiel. While I agree, there comes a point in time where it just becomes a cop out answer. I&amp;#39;m young and I have a lot of things to learn but, don&amp;#39;t discount how I feel. I&amp;#39;m no longer spiraling like I was two years ago asking what&amp;#39;s wrong with me or what have I done wrong. There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with me in terms of having or deserving the affection love or care from my preferred gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#39;s completely normal not to have those experiences but, I don&amp;#39;t want to hold hands for the first time the same year I start looking for my first apartment. I want him to still be a boy. I want to preserve whatever innocent excitement I might have about this stupidly inefficient action that shows affection. For once I want to be kissed without being felt up or the presumptive agreement of a sex act. But apparently wanting to be kissed for the sake of being kissed is something that&amp;#39;s too much to ask for. I feel so pathetic every time I think about it. I&amp;#39;m young but at the same time, I&amp;#39;m running out of time to have whatever idyllic picture perfect teenage romance. In my head it&amp;#39;s the only way I can properly prepare myself for a partner in the future. Even though a lot of first or real relationships happen in your twenties, I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;ll ever compare to one I might have during this time in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s just something special about getting together knowing it&amp;#39;ll end but, making most of the number of days you do have together. With college acceptances slowly rolling in and the number of guys I&amp;#39;m romantically interested in so few and far between, I don&amp;#39;t think the next five months will be enough for me to experience this serendipitous memory so many people affectionately recall. At this point acceptance is the only answer and even if I&amp;#39;ve know since I was 5 years old, it&amp;#39;s the biggest heartbreak I&amp;#39;ll ever have to heal from.&lt;/p&gt;

,love,"WARNING: EXTREMELY LONG READ

I’m a 21 y/o guy and I’m divorced. I met my ex when I was 13 at a football game between our two little towns. At 15 we started talking again and a month later we were dating. She was so beautiful and to this day even after the divorce she is still undeniably beautiful. That came with a twist however, in which I would find out later.

What was “I could never be mad at you for anything” the first couple months became “why are you always screwing up” and fighting every day. 6 months in the physical abuse she laid on me started, and then never ended. By 2 years in I was no longer “babe, honey, or sweetie”. I was “dumbass” or “dipshit”. You would think I would have left then. She forced choices on me. Gave me ultimatums. The day I graduated high school it was “you have a week to move in with me or we’re done” I moved out the next day. A few months later it was “we need to get our own place right now or we’re done”. We had our first apartment 2 weeks later. A year and a half later it was “we are getting engaged tonight or go home, take your shit, and I never want to see you again.” I was only 19 at the time.

That next year, August 17th, 2019, we were married. 6 months later (1 week before my 21st birthday) she cheats on me, blames me for it, we agree to separate, and 2 weeks later she has a new boyfriend that she’s bringing back to the apartment that I literally still live in with all my stuff still in it. I filed for divorce, move out and move back in with my parents.

I knew long ago at the start of our relationship that her and I weren’t perfect matched. We had many different interests and different personalities. We weren’t fitting puzzle pieces but god did I want it to work. Just force the two pieces together and make them fit. I was too committed. I loved too hard. I was so blinded by it that I never stopped to grasp that the way she was treating me was borderline worthy of being arrested for on multiple occasions. Toward the end of our relationship, even prior to the wedding I was becoming aware of it. And even started making it known to her I was aware of it. I lost my drive. I lost my passion. I sunk into depression. I didn’t want to live anymore. I stopped eating. 6ft tall and only 130lbs. 

I made a promise to myself that day I would never let something like that ever happen to me again. That pain, torture, neglect, abuse. Never again. I promised I would stay single a minimum of one year. As of right now, as I’m typing this post... tomorrow will be one year since the day she cheated on me.

In the time I’ve been single I have made many changes in my life. I started eating better and working out vigorously. I got they motorcycle I had always wanted. Started hanging out with more of my friends nearly every weekends. Parties and clubs and bars. So many women, MFF threesomes, Drinking and even fell into a handful of various drugs, some drugs harder and more expensive than others.

But about a month and a half ago I met this girl on tinder of all places. We had no intentions of anything at the start. No feelings, just get to know each other. After about 3 or 4 nights in a row of just talking until 4 in the morning... it became apparent to me that this girl is like me in nearly every aspect. So much we agree on, and so much in common in such oddly specific ways that at this point it’s become absurd, amusing, and kinda scary. We like the same constellation (Orion), the same star (Betelgeuse), the same stand up comedian (John Mulaney) and we quote his shit to each other multiple times a day every day in our normal conversations, similar classic car interests, similar drive for knowledge and learning, similar outlooks on life, similar aspects of our past, similar political standings, we are both helpless neck deep in meme culture.

She’s so vibrant, so alive, so caring. We aren’t even dating and she is already taking care of me like we’ve been together for years. She scratches my back, gives me massages, ogles over me. This last week I got really sick was unable to leave my bed for almost 5 days. She was by my side the whole time tending to me, stayed the night with me, watched movies, kept me company, comforted me, gave me pain meds, water, food. She was there the whole time. These are things I could never receive from my ex wife even if I asked nicely or did favors for her. Where as this one just does it because she wants to and cares. Naturally I am the same caring type of way. I’ve matched her energy in care giving and it absolutely floors her because no one has ever treated her the way she treats them. No one has ever in the slightest returned the favor for her. It blows her away being treated so well. And it blows me away that no one has ever treated her the way I treat her because I’ve been doing what I feel it the tire natural way a person that you care about should be treated.

She’s thinks I’m out of her league but I thinks she’s out of my league. She’s so beautiful. Petite, blonde hair, blue eyes, cute as a button, adorable, sexy, stunning, she’s just everything. And she’s not a total lunatic. Not a psycho. Like she has actual ambition and she’s so well put together. She refers to me as a unicorn because she can’t believe I guy as attractive as me could have a personality so caring and gentle and funny and full as the one I possess. And I would say the exact same thing about her. It almost feels too good to be true. She’s so perfect. I’m not afraid of her. She actually communicates her feelings. She doesn’t yell. She doesn’t get angry or upset about things she tells me if something bothers her and I can make a correction. No harm no fuss. I’m... I’m happy. I’m actually happy for the first time in years. Even before I was engaged. I’m happy. We aren’t even dating yet. But at this point it’s inevitable. She told me she is planning this big speech that she wants to give me prior to us going official. I decided to do that same. I’m going to write this speech out in return.

“It feels too right to be wrong” she says. “I’ve never fallen this hard this fast” which is something we have now both said to each other. I’m ready for this. I want this more than anything in the world and I can’t let a girl like slip through my fingers. For the first time ever I think I actually found the puzzle piece that really truly fits.

She was beautiful and there was something about her that sparked feelings in me. After the event I emailed her asking to keep in touch and so we messaged each other on Facebook. 

For the first time in a long time I've been feeling affectionate about someone and I didn't want to waste this opportunity. I don't know if she feels the same way about me, but assuming she does feel the same way, I've been thinking about whether it's worth it. There is a pandemic and lots of restrictions regarding gatherings and what's open/closed. Due to this, it would probably mostly be an online relationship. There might be the possibility of meeting in person, while adhering to public health guidelines, though that is still risky and wouldn't be as intimate as it would've been before the pandemic.

,love,"I know we only been together for 2 years but I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with him.

Coming from toxic households, I have never been the type of girl to romanticize being married or even being in a relationship.. even when I was entering my 20s (23 now) dating was the last thing on my mind. I’ve always been emotionally distance, skeptical about marriage and having kids.

It started by exchanging information at a bar (we known about each other’s existence for 5 years, basically had some of the same friends but never talked to each other). We had our first date about a week after we exchange information at the bar. We got into deep talks and there were no awkward times. We had our first kiss/hook up at the beach -at night (he initiated the kiss and I initiated going skinny dipping after which led to hooking up). We went to his place, showered and then took a bath , were we hugged each other for a long time.. those hugs you give someone after you haven’t seen them for a long time ..I felt so comfortable with him. I fell asleep at his place, cuddled up with him.... I left to go home at around 10 am. I have NEVER spend the whole night at someone’s house just like that.... but this didn’t feel like a one nightstand, I didn’t feel “dirty”- not that having one nightstands are a bad thing but I personally always felt empty after... instead I felt butterflies in my stomach, I felt like I was on cloud nine. I didn’t want to jinx it so I shut my mouth and didn’t tell any of my friends, only my sister. The next two weeks I was completely love drunk (still am) and he asked me out... I said yes, I have never said yes to someone asking me out because I take dating very seriously, and I always thought I would have to be friends with someone for years before they can ask me out... but in that moment all my beliefs about dating were non existent. 

In the begging of our relationship I was so pessimistic that it was going to end because everything was going too perfect...but it’s been two years and the only things that’s changed would be our comfortable level, knowing more about each other, and growing more as people. 

We see each other everyday, there are good days but some days he can be distant and I can be too emotional/sensitive but we talk it through and make it work. I learned that we don’t have to like each other all the time because our love for each other is always there and grows stronger every time. 

I love him so much. He gives me so much love,support, respect and confidence. He brings out my inner child, by playing games with me. We sing, dance and bake cookies together. He cradles me, gives me kisses all over and carries me to bed. He is the sweetest, most attractive person( inside and out) I have ever met.... maybe also the most annoying but I’m also annoying so it works out lol. I have never been so honest, put down my ego so much and been so in love with someone. 

I hope we are a forever couple, I never pictured myself being such a lovey person....I never thought I would ever plan my future with somebody... I never thought I would someday want to be married and have children.

Because of the long distance she decided to break up with me and I was so devastated because I really loved her but I knew that long distance is not gonna work especially there was no way to live in the same city for a least 3 to 4 years until we both finish uni .

I stay 1 ,5 years single not dating anyone trying to get over her and after around 2 years in 2019 I started dating again and I was in a couple of relationships but none of them lasted more than 4 month and I wasn't as happy as I was her her.

Now in 2021 she tried to reconnect with me and she moved to my city and tbh I am starting to think about settling down now but I am afraid that now we are not as compatible as we used to and we went out one time and I am starting to catch feelings fast and reminiscing about the past .

INITIAL KEY

M- my ride or die best friend, love her to death

H- my best friend’s sister, a sweetheart

J- my make best friend, he’s an angel

E- was another best friend, currently my boyfriend

C- my ex fling

K- was best friend until she betrayed everyone I love in many ways, including me. (But i was more mad she hurt my friends than me tbh)


~STORY~

       My current boyfriend (E) and I met briefly about a year and a half (september-ish 2019) at a birthday party for my best friend(M)‘s little sister (H) when one of our other best friends(J) stopped by to say hi. I don’t remember much from that night but I remember thinking he was super cute and wishing I had the balls to talk to him for the short time he was there. 

      About a month or so later E and i unknowingly matched on bumble. We texted for a few days before realizing we had this mutual friend and had met before. but unfortunately my account was banned. (I was 17 at the time he was 19) I thought he’d reported me for being underage and was disappointed but didn’t think much of it. 

      A few days later, J said he and E would be hanging out after work (they worked together at the time) and invited me to join. I reluctantly agreed, being completely embarrassed. We met up at a barnes and nobles and hung out in the Starbucks. As soon as we hung out I just knew he was special. I learned that he didn’t report me and actually thought i unmatched. I assured him that wasn’t the case, we exchanged snapchats and we began texting every day.

      I eventually found out he’d recently gotten out of a long term relationship so he said he wasn’t looking to jump into anything and wanted to just get to know each other. I said that was totally fine and was ready to just be friends. But after that conversation he continued to flirt and be touchy feely with me. Never tried anything sexual so I was confused on his intentions. 

      At this point he’s integrated into our friend group of me, J, and M (and some others but they’re not around anymore and this sub is about love so I’m not bringing that mess up here) About a month into the continuous mixed signals (december-ish 2019) i basically straight up asked him “do you want to be something or??” Because i was beginning to catch real feelings. He told me he was sorry and didn’t mean to lead me on but he just wasn’t ready to be in a relationship again yet. His mental health was struggling because of school and such, and he didn’t want to risk it.

       I told him it was fine, but to please respect my personal boundaries so I didn’t confuse his affection for feelings. He kept apologizing but I said it was fine because truly it was. We got close as friends over the next couple months until a big ole mess of drama happens that wasn’t just a love triangle, it was a like a love octagon. 

       Long story short, 

- I was talking to a boy we’ll call C, who I did like a lot, But still had feelings for E. 

-J had feelings for another of our best friends (NOT ANYMORE) named K.

-E still didn’t wanna be with anyone

-K had manipulative intentions to get with E so he’d join her side in trying to kick someone else out of our friend group.

      Basically at M’s birthday party (February 2020) K flirted with M all night, J was upset, I was upset, K knew I still had feelings for E, M was clueless, E was too drunk to notice. After J and I left, E and K kissed. J and I didn’t found out about the kiss until the next night. So in the morning I simply told E not to hurt K. (Because she was still my friend and I didn’t know her real intentions yet) and he apologized and said he was really sorry and he didn’t mean to hurt me and didn’t think I had feelings for him anymore because I was talking with C.

      I told him it’s fine just don’t hurt her, to which he replied “I don’t think anything’s gonna happen between K and I. We were drunk.” (We later found out K was pretending to be drunk) but he assured me he felt awful that he didn’t feel the same way about me I did about him. I told him I just needed some space and I’d be fine and nothing would change. We were still great friends and i wasn’t gonna let a crush ruin that. 

      Fast forward 5 months, we are still great friends. The four of us (M,J,E, and me) had become basically inseparable. Constantly hanging out. Doing dumb young friend shit. When all of a sudden, slowly over a few weeks E began being more touchy and flirty again. I didn’t want to embarrass myself so I let it slide. 

      Then he started inviting me to hang out at his house when he’d get off work. He lives 35 minutes away from me and was working the closing shift as a pizza delivery boy so usually wouldn’t be done until 12:30 or 1. Because of this he’d offer me to stay the night since I’d slept on his couch a few times before when J and I would go over.

      The first time I went over, I was so nervous. I’d been there before, but it was the first time being alone with him since we were hanging out alone back in December. It was now August. We stayed up watching movies, talking, playing minecraft in his room and smoking weed. Finally it was nearing 330am and we’d decided we wanted to watch a movie and then go to bed. He asked if I wanted to watch in the living-room or on his laptop in bed. Me having not laid down in 8+ hours that day decided on the bed because my back was hurting. 

      We put on one of the Nightmare on Elm street movies and laid down. We didn’t pay much attention though as we were both going in and out of consciousness as-well as laughing and talking about random shit. Eventually we knew we couldn’t finish the movie and needed to sleep. I asked him if he wanted me to go to the couch, and he told me i could stay in bed if i wanted. I nervously agreed.

      To my surprise he once again tried nothing sexual, no groping, kiss attempts, nothing. I was confused but content and I fell asleep. When I woke up in the morning his arm was around me and I was cuddled into his chest. I waited for him to wake up and move away before I ‘woke up’ said goodbye and left for the day. I was more confused than ever. This continued for like 2 weeks, the cuddling and flirting becoming more and more intense, yet still so innocent. 

       It made me so happy, yet confused and frustrated again, feeling like I was in the same spot I’d been with him nearly a year prior. Until one night we were laying down, about to fall asleep after a night of movies, weed, and minecraft, and we were talking quietly face to face. Asking random life questions. At some point we both went quiet, our faces inched closer and we kissed. I immediately knew I would one day love him. If I didn’t already. It was the most passionate, magical, innocent kiss I’ve ever had. I felt like I was in a movie.

       After a few minutes I pulled away and asked what this was. He told me he wasn’t exactly sure, but he knew he liked me and wanted to take things slow and see where they went. I told him I liked him too and was fine with that. I had to ask about the past though, it was eating at me. I asked how he really felt all this time since we met. He told me he’d always had feelings for me, but was scared to tell me because he knew he wasn’t ready to date yet, (he had a bad ex) and was scared if he was honest I’d be mad or stop being his friend or do something crazy. He apologized for not being honest sooner. I assured him I understood and I’m just glad he was ready to try.

      We kept seeing each other until Halloween when we made it official. We have now been seeing each other for over 6 months, officially together for 4, and officially in love for 1. I haven’t been this happy with someone in a while and I’m thrilled. So yeah, that’s the story of us :)

,love,"This is dedicated to men and women, who are over-giving in life.

Stop over-giving and learn to receive.

We all value giving. We like people who are giving and generous. We praise our friends and families when they give something to someone. Because it is altruistic at its core.

Then what about receiving?

Interestingly, we associate receiving as something negative. But we need to understand that The art of receiving is as important as the art of giving. It is hard to see the benefit of receiving. Instead, sometimes we guilt people when they receive something from us.

What we ignore from time to time is that Over-giving can lead to some unhealthy emotions or habits.

Then, What is the risk of over-giving in a long term:

It builds up resentment. When someone is giving, they might never expect themselves to be resentful about it, they might think they are giving happily. But they can start to notice some resentful self-talk in them.

2. It makes you exhausted. I think this is obvious. Over-giving exhausts your body and soul. You don’t have enough time to relax, rest and think for yourself.

You might end up feeling unloved and lonely. If you keep rejecting when someone wants to give or if you don’t know how to receive, you might create a situation where you end up feeling no one loves you.

3. It makes you feel hopeless. In a long run, it will seem like you are on your own and no one cares.

4. Sometimes when you over-give, some people could perceive it as you being controlling. Although many of us think that it is noble to give, when we try too hard, some people can think you are trying to manipulate.

You might fall into a victim mindset. This is the worst. It is very harmful to live in this kind of mindset. When we feel like a victim, we receive more attention from others. And this can lead us to want to stay in this victim mindset.

5. Over-giving makes you appreciate things less. This one is not very obvious. For over givers, when someone gives them something, they might not be able to appreciate it enough, because they might think “comparing to what I give, what is this?”

We need to balance giving and receiving. It is not healthy to over-give and to reject what others are willing to give us. Instead of feeling shame, embrace the virtues of vulnerability and learn how to receive. When we receive, when we feel we are loved, we will have more to give.",t2_8xgvn27f,False,,0,False,What is the downside of over-giving?

&lt;p&gt;Stop over-giving and learn to receive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all value giving. We like people who are giving and generous. We praise our friends and families when they give something to someone. Because it is altruistic at its core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then what about receiving?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, we associate receiving as something negative. But we need to understand that The art of receiving is as important as the art of giving. It is hard to see the benefit of receiving. Instead, sometimes we guilt people when they receive something from us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we ignore from time to time is that Over-giving can lead to some unhealthy emotions or habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, What is the risk of over-giving in a long term:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It builds up resentment. When someone is giving, they might never expect themselves to be resentful about it, they might think they are giving happily. But they can start to notice some resentful self-talk in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes you exhausted. I think this is obvious. Over-giving exhausts your body and soul. You don’t have enough time to relax, rest and think for yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might end up feeling unloved and lonely. If you keep rejecting when someone wants to give or if you don’t know how to receive, you might create a situation where you end up feeling no one loves you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It makes you feel hopeless. In a long run, it will seem like you are on your own and no one cares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

How could you say you’re ugly, when I fall in love with you all over again each day. You’re so perfect. You literally can’t be ugly because seeing you makes me heard flutter, it feels like feeling the first rays of sunlight on my skin, or watching a shooting star go past. You’re so incredible and if I could just stare at you I would, I’d stare into those amazing eyes of yours that I’m always to lose myself in. I’d stare at your adorable smile, the one you do when no one else is around, the smile just for me that makes my heart melt. I’d stare at your fluffy hair and think about how much I adore running my fingers through it because it means I’ve got you close to me. I want to rest my head against your chest and hear your heart beat, I want to be close to you. I need to be close to you. I need to have you in my arms, or be in yours. You mean the world and beyond to me, I wish I could explain it, and I wish I could show you just how I feel. You need to know how perfect you are, you need to see you how I do. Maybe if you did, you’d truely understand? I probably won’t send this to you, but if I did then, surprise, you’ve found one of the many entries I have in my diary. Anyway. God, every time I play this song I think of you, y’know that? You fill my mind all the time, little things cause it. A song, a colour, something we’ve spoken about, anything really. God... your laugh is so enchanting, I can’t wait to hear it when you come over. The pure happiness I hear when you laugh around me, the laugh only I get to hear, special, mine. The laugh that you do when you let yourself go. Gods it fills my heart with warmth like you wouldn’t even believe, it makes me want to hold you as close to me as physically possible. You’re so amazing. You’re so perfect. I wish I could send this to you, but instead I’ll probably just copy paste it, wish to send it and then I’ll delete it, it’ll stay here. I just want you to know how much I love you without sounding clingy, which is silly because you seem to like it. Gods, you’re so amazing, it feels like I can do anything with you, I can do or say anything and you’d be on board, using that calming voice you unconsciously use when you’re being caring, the one that feels like when I wrap myself up in cosy blankets and feel completely safe.

I want to lay beside you in my room late and night and set up the projector I have in my room, I wanna set it up and have my lights on low, I want to lay inter the covers, all snuggled up with you while watching how to train your dragon, giggling about parts in the movie, or about each other.

He dropped everything to see me when he found out I was in town for a short while and we have been talking at depth ever since.  We have had many missed connections with each other over the years because we always were with other people, but now we are both single.  We found out our love is still very alive.

--

So.. Here's what we're up to now.  I wanted to wait a few months to see him (I was thinking June) but he said he couldn't wait any longer to see me.  He is flying here this Monday!  He is staying here for 4 days.  We haven't made ourselves an ""official"" couple yet because I want it to be in person but he's already calling me his girlfriend to his coworkers (he asked if I was ok with that, and I am).  We've been so excited and nervous to see each other and have all those first-times all over again.  My stomach has been doing backflips as I'm waiting.

He created a secret facebook group for both of us and we post our musings in there for each other.  He writes a lot of poetry about me (he always has even when we were apart for over a decade--he often used variations of my name or hidden messages only I would get in his poems to hint it was about me).  He's even made stuff up on the fly (spoken word) poetry and I'm honestly impressed by his creativity and skill.  I really don't know of any other spoken word poets, but I love being adored like this by someone so romantic and creative.  I like to draw so I've used his loving words as an artpiece inspiration.  I like to look at it and feel how deep his love for me goes.

I'm enjoying getting to know him as an adult, we've both been through a lot in our lives.  He's had successes and failures, he became homeless when he turned 18 (a year after I left him) but got the assistance he needed and turned his life around by his mid 20s.  He is stable now and successful with what he does.  I'm so proud of him, I never knew how much he struggled growing up, and he didn't realize the same for me.  We didn't talk about that that much when we were kids so as adults we can understand the bigger picture a bit more as to why we ended it still long ago.

He said it feels wonderful I'm back.. he's hidden his love for me for years and every other woman since has been a 'placeholder' (he felt bad using that word but he said its true).  Honestly I feel the same way with the other men I've been with.  I've been waiting around for a love like his to show up in them.. Always searching never finding it.. Because I was looking for uniquely him. Never realizing we could actually have each others hearts again until now.  It's just so pure.  I feel so blessed.  I'll do another update after he comes out here.

Oh and to everyone in my last post who had been encouraging me to move back.. I just might.. We have been talking about that a bit but want to get through all the firsts again.. first kiss (redux) and everything else that follows.. He said he is fine moving out here and I'm starting to be more ok with the idea of me moving back to where he (and my family) are.  He said we also can move to an entirely new area/state if we want to.  He said it's up to me, he just wants to be wherever I am.  Lots to think about and plan.  He said after this trip he wants to travel here to see me every two months.. Eeee..

,love,"This is kind of dumb, but it’s just me talking about her even though she may see this. 

I just really like spending time with her. She’s probably one of my only relationships in real life that I was able to be comfortable with. I love spending time with her when we’re just hanging out and playing games, cuddling, or even sleeping. I feel so loved and relaxed around her, it’s like I have nothing to worry about. 

When we’re with our friends, she makes me feel special and like i’m not the same as all of the others. We both compliment two of our friends a LOT and while sometimes I get a tiny bit jealous, she never fails to make me feel seen. 

I see her everyday. Everyday I am able to chat with her and hang out with her. Today is one of the few days that I won’t be seeing her since we both need to get covid tests and we’re quarantining until we both get them back negative. I am sad about it; however I know I will just look forward to seeing her even more than I usually do.

,love,"i just have to gush, and what better place than the black hole of reddit. anyways, yesterday was my girlfriend and I’s 1 year. which is so crazy and amazing, it’s my longest relationship. everything feels so official now, my mom even told us “happy anniversary” which is a big deal, since she’s not usually the congratulatory type. to celebrate, we dyed our hair the same color the night before which was so fun and cute. and for the real celebration, i convinced her i made reservations at a nice restaurant and it was very fancy. but really, i actually set up a little fancy restaurant area in my basement and cooked everything myself. vegetarian french onion soup, rigatoni alla vodka, fancy oil and balsamic dipping bread, chocolate melting cake for dessert, and i even got a lemon for the waters. i set up a third chair for us, which held a very extensive book of so many pictures of us and little captions for all of them, a little stuffed animal, a chocolate love robot, a minecraft blind bag, and a hoodie (since i steal all of hers). she was shocked we weren’t actually going to a restaurant, but she said all the love she tasted in my food made it so much better than any restaurant we could’ve went to. in return, she got me a HUGE cow stuffed animal, a board of pictures of us, a card with pictures of us, a boyfriend certificate, snacks, a huge blanket, and a cookie cake, which is my favorite dessert. i slept in her arms and gushed about her so hard, how cute she is, how amazing she is, just how happy she makes me. i smiled so cheesy about nothing and everything that my cheeks hurt. i’m so helplessly and beautifully in love, and it’s been a year of having such intense feelings. a year of going to sleep feeling safe, a year of the best year i’ve ever had. i can’t stop smiling thinking about it all",t2_59e9etiw,False,,0,False,my girlfriend and i’s 1 year,[],r/love,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_lo81kc,False,light,0.94,,public,13,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},gushing,False,13,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1613859591.0,text,6,,,text,self.love,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;i just have to gush, and what better place than the black hole of reddit. anyways, yesterday was my girlfriend and I’s 1 year. which is so crazy and amazing, it’s my longest relationship. everything feels so official now, my mom even told us “happy anniversary” which is a big deal, since she’s not usually the congratulatory type. to celebrate, we dyed our hair the same color the night before which was so fun and cute. and for the real celebration, i convinced her i made reservations at a nice restaurant and it was very fancy. but really, i actually set up a little fancy restaurant area in my basement and cooked everything myself. vegetarian french onion soup, rigatoni alla vodka, fancy oil and balsamic dipping bread, chocolate melting cake for dessert, and i even got a lemon for the waters. i set up a third chair for us, which held a very extensive book of so many pictures of us and little captions for all of them, a little stuffed animal, a chocolate love robot, a minecraft blind bag, and a hoodie (since i steal all of hers). she was shocked we weren’t actually going to a restaurant, but she said all the love she tasted in my food made it so much better than any restaurant we could’ve went to. in return, she got me a HUGE cow stuffed animal, a board of pictures of us, a card with pictures of us, a boyfriend certificate, snacks, a huge blanket, and a cookie cake, which is my favorite dessert. i slept in her arms and gushed about her so hard, how cute she is, how amazing she is, just how happy she makes me. i smiled so cheesy about nothing and everything that my cheeks hurt. i’m so helplessly and beautifully in love, and it’s been a year of having such intense feelings. a year of going to sleep feeling safe, a year of the best year i’ve ever had. i can’t stop smiling thinking about it all&lt;/p&gt;

I had 2 choices; live with my mom in New York or go to Pennsylvania to live with my bestfriend and her sisters family where I was guaranteed a job there. I chose to live with my bestfriend because my mom didn’t want me out there in New York with the virus plus who doesn’t want to live with their bestfriend who u have feelings for and think is hella beautiful. Yes I had feelings for my bestfriend because at the time I was also going thru a very bad breakup with my ex. And she was there when shit got really rough for me so a lot of feelings did arise from that plus we previously dated in the past. She was also goin thru a bad breakup with a guy at the time, so when I came to PA we already started flirting and having sex etc etc. After a month we really started hitting it off and her birthday (October 18th) I was gonna ask her out. The day came and I asked her out and she said yes. I was really happy at the time, more happy knowing I finally had someone that was more understanding and who completed me.  A month  went by and she basically told me she was cheating on me with her ex that she had recently broke up with, I was really heartbroken and from that point i didn’t kno what to do. She suggested that we just be bestfriends again and it didn’t work out with her and this guy we could try dating again, so since I loved her and I just want her to be happy I said yes. A few weeks later, she found other women on his phone so she ended it with him. So we dating again, now it’s 2021 and we didn’t work out again because of her ex. Now I’m sitting here extremely upset, now she wants to be just bestfriends again, this guy has shown that he has really changed and he wants to be with her so as the nice guy that I am I let her do her thing with him, now their getting serious and I’m trying to be the bestfriend she wants me to be but I can’t get these deep feelings for her outta my head, Plus since we share a room together, I have to hear their phone calls and it makes me uncomfortable and hurt at times. I’m dealing with feelings that I’ve never felt before, insecurity and jealousy During that time me and her have been told by her sister that we may need to move out soon because she is pregnant and needs the extra room for the baby. So we need to find a place to live. Since we can’t really afford a place together, he offered that all 3 of us get a place together (he knows bout the history between me and her) and I honestly don’t know how to feel bout that. I don’t kno how comfortable I would be bout it, but at the same time I don’t wanna let her go and leave her when she really wants me to go thru with this. This last couple of weeks especially I’ve realized that I really am in love with this girl and idk want the future holds between us. I’ve been on Tinder just to try to get this feeling outta my system at least but she hasn’t been comfortable with it because she still has feelings for me so I deleted it.

,love,"So, here is the case broken down:

I have been together with my girl for almost two years. Never ever have I been more sure in my life that she is the one for me. Today, tomorrow and until we grow old. Our interests, activities, love for nature, summer, winter, sports and dogs are equal. We have lived together for a year, and were up until recently chatting about buying a house. However, some months ago I got the opportunity of my dreams, with an amazing job. The only problem? It was in a different country (same timezone). We agreed that it would be madness not to take it, so in the following months we discussed on the best ways to deal with the situation (distance relationship). We tried to think of any probabilities that may occur and solve them beforehand. We talked about how COVID would affect the situation, and agreed that although it would be though, we would make the best of it. That when it got better she would come down to visit me. And then I moved. 

Fast forward to today. COVID situation have imposed even harsher lockdowns, not making travel very easy. My schedule consists basically of going to work - working 12-13 hrs /day, then coming home and working out and going to bed. This leaves almost no time for us, and it's put me in somewhat of a squeeze. If I come home without exercise, I won't be happy, and if that's not the case, it's a probability that we won't be having a pleasant conversation over the phone (which is everything we got atm).

Recently it got to a point where we are rethinking our situation. It is not making any of us happy, and to be honest I'm clueless of what to do, hence this post. It is a typical love or career question.

I mean, I really love her and I really want to be with her all day, exploring, hiking, and living. But at the same time I love what I'm doing, and I just wish I could be with her at the same time. That would be the ideal situation. Currently I am working my ass of trying to keep the rope together, but if it drags out more, then I don't know what will happen.

But I am facing one problem currently. I cant think of anything to base this song on.

I want this song to be meaningful so I'm not gonna rush it and write random sentences, but rather wait for lines to pop up in my head and in my life and I think that'll kinda do the trick.

,love,"I have had a lot of issues regarding my love life which is one of the reasons why I am still single until now, and never experiencing dating with someone.

So, I used to have a problem with myself for a while, like 4 years that I have recently fixed with a psychologist.  That was the worst time of my life, so far, cause every single day I thought myself as an impostor because I feel like a hypocrite to everyone around me. But thank God, it's all a lot better now.

But, even though i have feel a lot better now, i still have this weird feelings towards women who are nice to me. To make it simple, if I'm interacting with a women whom I don't like (and most of those women have apparence that I consider as ugly) i would still be nice to them, but when they repay the kindness i always back down and making sure there is a gap between me and them and doing something for making sure that they don't like me just because I'm kind to them. 

It's not good, i know, but it all happens like automaticly and I have tried myself to suppressed it. But it never works... I'm scared and confused right now. I don't know what to do.

,love,"We're combining celebrating Valentine's &amp; our anniversary this weekend, and my bf booked a hotel in the city. Initially, I felt guilty for him planning all of this, but then I saw how excited he was with all these ideas! He asked if my exes ever done something like this, and I said my exes never took me on overnight dates/trips. He had such a huge smile on his face, and every time I said he doesn't have to go overboard to make me happy, he said *he wants to*. That we deserve to live the ""bougie life"" once in a while- I had to laugh.  

He also wrote a long card apparently (We both write ridiculously long cards to each other).

The hotel has a nice view from the bed (based on photos), and there's a *bubble bath*. He said we'll order *room service* and *Champagne (*something I never done in any hotel)*.* There's places to eat inside the hotel and around the area. He's also bringing *board games* if it's too cold out/when we're inside our rooms. I tend to forget (and regret) not taking photos of our dates, but he said get ready for all the selfies I want. He also likes to be silly and have me pose for his ""photoshoot,"" even when I'm dressed like a bum in sweats.

He also said it's just nice going somewhere just the two of us. I always go over his place, but he lives with parents and siblings. (And I live with my mom in a small apartment, so he ain't sleeping over my place).

,love,"I(20M) have been very hung up on this girl who i had crush on in school. I did say about my feelings to her when were in 8th grade, she didn't know how to react and just cut me off (she did speak about me behind my back). We never spoke since, but we did just have a formal conversation at our school farewell. Cut three years later she follows me on Instagram and starts texting me and even starts asking alot about the girl who i was in relationship back then.
 I did confront on how she was hard on me, but she just brushed it of saying ""we were kids back then come on"". We have been doing nothing but texting and sending each other memes for the next two years, we did even meet once when i came to my hometown. 

Since lockdown our texting has gone way to high and we have been having very deep conversations. I did like the ""new her"" because we connected alot and had lot of mutual interests. I did find it very warm when i was having conversations with her and slowly we have started to flirt in a funny way, and she even once said how she regreted of not accepting my proposal back at school. I actually had butterflies in my stomach when she said that, but the shy me just replied ""I am flattered"". 

Past two months she always replies to my messages like two days after  even though i know she is online (Because she likes other posts), this made me feel really unwanted and i had really negative vibes so i decided to deactivate my account and thought let me not talk to her henceforth .

Just a day after deactivating my account she texted my number, asking what happened. I just replied ""Detox"" she started conversing again and i like a fool started conversing again even though i did not want to talk to her. Again she didn't reply to my messages past some days.

I again feel hurt.
Am i desperate?
Or am i just obsessed with her?



2 days back we started talking again and we have been sharing alot of memes and hella lot of flirty texts which started as a joke. I have now started telling what all i would do for her in a joke like manner. For ex: if she says something cute i reply ""omg you look so cute, can i take you out on a burger date today"" i just add on a laughing emoji to make it seem funny. She feels insecure about her weight and trust me nothing gets me super annoyed when she says she ain't beautiful! 

Also i keep hinting on, oh we should meet and stuff like that. She says oh ya we should, but never takes the plan forward!!

I think am crushing on her

,love,"Today I fucked up by intentionally searching and googling my ex gf, only to find out she has moved on and gotten married over the last 2 months. 

I thought I had moved on and went on with my life through the worst second half of that year. Moved out of that depressing apartment and moved in with some buddies from college. Got done exceedingly well at work, well enough to get a raise and this year started off looking promising. Had plans to save up and get a motorcycle too. Was almost done with my vehicle loan. Picked up a new hobby of playing piano too.

All was fine until I decided to see whats up and how my ex was doing. Turns out she got married to some guy months after we broke up and now has even taken his last name. I fucked up my mental peace. I know I shouldn't be sabotaging myself and my mental health. I literally feel like shit right now. Its amazing how I thought I was bored and decided to go on the only social media I am active [other than reddit] Facebook. Saw her face but with a different last name and saw some pictures of her wedding. I dont even know why she unblocked me, my mind goes crazy thinking about that. For the entire time we were together, I cherished each and everyday we were together and made me dumb enough to forgive her when she was cheating on me but there was something about her that just made everything seem so light.

Luckily, she said yes and we aren&amp;#39;t technically dating yet though she knows I love her and have for a good while now and seems quite acquaint to the idea - almost happy in fact. But she&amp;#39;s changed: she was lovely and had medium/short length bleached brown hair when I met her, now she&amp;#39;s a bisexual goth. I don&amp;#39;t know why I&amp;#39;ve taken it so hard. She says she was in the closet for ages, but I feel so excluded. I hope the goth thing is just a phase too, she was a dyed black &amp;#39;shag&amp;#39; now (like what flappers had in 1920&amp;#39;s America, I think?), which of course looks very lesbian and anyone would thinks she&amp;#39;s bi from looking at her. She looks quite flamboyant, I suppose is the best way to put it. But I think there&amp;#39;s something unconditional about me loving her; I&amp;#39;ve wanted this for so long now: finally, I&amp;#39;ve got a new chance with her and things are looking up. I just wish she was her old self again, for God&amp;#39;s sake I&amp;#39;m such a dick. I hate myself. What can I do?&lt;/p&gt;

,love,"It MAY or MAY NOT be obvious from my name, but! I have been trying to raise awareness to the love we all share for Earth, one another, and to our favorite video gaming companies, Grocery stores, Car Brands, Etc.! Things Hoo-mans made! Things we cannot control. Things that hurt. Make us sing. Things that bring us smiles and tears!

&amp;#x200B;

And Ideas! Like DIAMOND HANDS (although I didn't participate in these because I am a poor boy, and if I got in at the beginning, you better bet your ass I'd have paper-handed! Hahaha!

&amp;#x200B;

I want to raise awareness to sober people and struggling addicts trying to stay sober. And the addict who is lurking and praying daily they can start the process of quitting TODAY!

&amp;#x200B;

Awareness. Of. Love. 

&amp;#x200B;

Joy!

&amp;#x200B;

PEACEE BRUDDAHHHH!

&amp;#x200B;

Memes. Silly jokes.

&amp;#x200B;

Family.

&amp;#x200B;

Et cetera! 

&amp;#x200B;

Some background - I have a month 3 days 2hrs and 56 mins and some seconds of sobriety as of THIS MOMENT. I am multi-racial. My parents are divorced. I have been raped as a child and as an adult. I am bi-sexual. I prefer women but because of my PTSD it is hard to be sexual with men. However, platonically, I have amazing male to male friendships. I meditate daily, and have been DIEING to start a donation based Yoga/Meditation class via Zoom daily for 3 hrs a day - 3 1hr segments. It is a dream of mine that may be achievable now that I have a laptop from a generous donor on r/Everquest so I can play my favorite MMORPG from my childhood (amongst other things). I am 26 Yrs old. Born in August. Leo-Virgo Cusp. I perform Tarot readings. I believe in a higher-power. I choose to call him God, but he isn't the ideal christian god or any other mainstream religion. I have a broken family. I have struggled on and off with my addiction but have had 2 close friends die in my arms this last go around so I KNOW that I will not be returning to using drugs. I don't think weed is a drug but I cannot smoke until June this year when my probation expires. I walked down an 8 year probation sentence after 2 yrs in jail and 8 years (when I am done) as a ""Freeman"". I am a writer but have had writers block for years. Reddit has helped me break that (as evidence in this post and previous post that I am writing more and longer). I had a 3.9GPA in highschool. Due to thinking ""drugs were so cool"" I lost a full-ride to college. I am in school for ""audio engineering"" because I want to be able to produce and manage artists and make albums for myself and others that want to break into the industry at an affordable price. And I just LOVE PEOPLE, MUSIC, and FANTASY!

&amp;#x200B;

So, let me add my little piece for the awareness of love today! I intend to make a post everyday singling out one major act of love a day that occurred in my life. I brought it up to my therapist and she thinks it would be a great idea to do this!

&amp;#x200B;

SO! Thank you, and I love you tooooo... My Therapist! I will leave her name out for anonymity for myself and her.

My therapist is amazing. We have talked twice in the last two weeks over the phone for two 35 minute sessions. The state has funded programs and has given me my therapist at no charge. So today she called me out of the blue even though our next session isn't for three weeks! 

She has me on a ""cancellation"" list because I am ""high-risk"" for self-harm and other things due to my mental health conditions and post-traumatic-stress-disorder. 

Alongside being Manic-depressive bi-polar, the medication I usually take really helps! However, my insurance lapsed due to aging out (turning 26) and my medicine went from affordable ($8-15/mo to $186-242/mo depending on if I just got the major important things or all of it but that isn't the point! I, god-willing, will have my meds given back to me by the state Feb 25th as long as the psych eval. goes well and they deem me ""in need"". I am grinding my teeth and hardening my spirit to make it there and through the month after beginning taking my meds because those who take anti-depressants know they don't kick in ""immediately"" but the placebo relief does. Knowing you have them is a big relief. As aforementioned, I was raped as a child and as an adult Feb 2020 so I have been deemed worthy by the therapy gods, lol, to deserve free therapy but so far not free medicine. I personally think everyone should have a therapist!!!

&amp;#x200B;

So I just want to say! Thank you, God, Thank you Mrs. Therapist for calling me more than once a month - because that is all you have to do, I really needed it today because I.. admittedly was having a lot of self-harm and depression thoughts today, and thank you to everyone who goes to therapy making it a real thing and profession that hasn't gone under due to Covid-19.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I love you all and can't wait to tell you the ""Major act of love"" in my life that happens tomorrow! We are all struggling. I know. If I could change the world overnight I would. But It'd still be broken because I don't know what's best. Most importantly, Thank you, for reading this. Being there. And being beautiful. Inside and out.

&amp;#x200B;

I love you. I am always available and sleep so softly that if you need someone desperately to talk to, message me three times. I'll wake up! Don't self-harm without talking it out first! Unless it's a kink, then have fun ;D. I've heard of ""Knife-play"" sounds fun. Hahaha!

&amp;#x200B;

I have been trying to raise awareness to the love we all share for Earth, one another, and to our favorite video gaming companies, Grocery stores, Car Brands, Etc.! Things Hoo-mans made! Things we cannot control. Things that hurt. Make us sing. Things that bring us smiles and tears!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Ideas! Like DIAMOND HANDS (although I didn&amp;#39;t participate in these because I am a poor boy, and if I got in at the beginning, you better bet your ass I&amp;#39;d have paper-handed! Hahaha!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to raise awareness to sober people and struggling addicts trying to stay sober. And the addict who is lurking and praying daily they can start the process of quitting TODAY!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awareness. Of. Love. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PEACEE BRUDDAHHHH!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memes. Silly jokes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Et cetera! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some background - I have a month 3 days 2hrs and 56 mins and some seconds of sobriety as of THIS MOMENT. I am multi-racial. My parents are divorced. I have been raped as a child and as an adult. I am bi-sexual. I prefer women but because of my PTSD it is hard to be sexual with men. However, platonically, I have amazing male to male friendships. I meditate daily, and have been DIEING to start a donation based Yoga/Meditation class via Zoom daily for 3 hrs a day - 3 1hr segments. It is a dream of mine that may be achievable now that I have a laptop from a generous donor on &lt;a href=""/r/Everquest""&gt;r/Everquest&lt;/a&gt; so I can play my favorite MMORPG from my childhood (amongst other things). I am 26 Yrs old. Born in August. Leo-Virgo Cusp. I perform Tarot readings. I believe in a higher-power. I choose to call him God, but he isn&amp;#39;t the ideal christian god or any other mainstream religion. I have a broken family. I have struggled on and off with my addiction but have had 2 close friends die in my arms this last go around so I KNOW that I will not be returning to using drugs. I don&amp;#39;t think weed is a drug but I cannot smoke until June this year when my probation expires. I walked down an 8 year probation sentence after 2 yrs in jail and 8 years (when I am done) as a &amp;quot;Freeman&amp;quot;. I am a writer but have had writers block for years. Reddit has helped me break that (as evidence in this post and previous post that I am writing more and longer). I had a 3.9GPA in highschool. Due to thinking &amp;quot;drugs were so cool&amp;quot; I lost a full-ride to college. I am in school for &amp;quot;audio engineering&amp;quot; because I want to be able to produce and manage artists and make albums for myself and others that want to break into the industry at an affordable price. And I just LOVE PEOPLE, MUSIC, and FANTASY!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let me add my little piece for the awareness of love today! I intend to make a post everyday singling out one major act of love a day that occurred in my life. I brought it up to my therapist and she thinks it would be a great idea to do this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SO! Thank you, and I love you tooooo... My Therapist! I will leave her name out for anonymity for myself and her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My therapist is amazing. We have talked twice in the last two weeks over the phone for two 35 minute sessions. The state has funded programs and has given me my therapist at no charge. So today she called me out of the blue even though our next session isn&amp;#39;t for three weeks! &lt;/p&gt;

However, my insurance lapsed due to aging out (turning 26) and my medicine went from affordable ($8-15/mo to $186-242/mo depending on if I just got the major important things or all of it but that isn&amp;#39;t the point! I, god-willing, will have my meds given back to me by the state Feb 25th as long as the psych eval. goes well and they deem me &amp;quot;in need&amp;quot;.

,love,"I told myself I wouldn’t get ahead of myself. And maybe I’m not. I’ve taken little action, but it’s 24/7 in my head. I can’t stop thinking about her. 

I have a strong sense that she feels the same. I’m waiting for the right opportunity to make a move and let her know how I feel. I can hardly think of her sexually. That’s how I know it isn’t just lust. 

However, I’m scared that it’s just infatuation. I want it to be real. I’m scared it wouldn’t work, before it’s even begun. I want to love myself completely before I try to love someone else. To me, she’s the most beautiful person in any room. Even when there’s someone who everyone else would say is more beautiful, I only have eyes for her. 

I feel the same vibe from her towards me. That insecure part of me wonders why she cares. But I can’t listen to that. I have to ignore it and accept that I’d be worth her love, should it come.

,love," I met Sofia when we were 18 years old (now 30) at university I fell in love with her at first sight but I knew it would never work but we became very good friends basically she was the first friend I had in university and we were friends for almost 2 years until that after the end of semester party I took her to her house at the door of her building she told me that she loved me and gave me a kiss I had no choice but to say ""SORRY"" and to leave.

The next day I tried to call her to apologize even though I was surprised (since I never intuited or felt that she had the same feelings)

But I block myself by all means (phone, message, email, facebook, etc) as after 2 weeks I received a box with all my things that I had lent and left at home with a short note saying that I please do the same with his things and I did.

When the semester started again I knew that Sofia had changed all of her classes so as not to meet me.

I, who at that moment already knew that our friendship had ended, I let him know through his friends (who by the way hate me) that he would not be in the common areas and that he could be calm that he would even eat outside the university.

About 2 months later, I learned that Sofia started dating a boy named Tom who luckily is a good person and they have been together ever since.

After we graduated they went to live in Germany (we live in Switzerland) I learned from her best friend (who also hates me to death) that the main reason they went to Germany was that she did not want to meet me as it was inevitable because of him. field that we study (there are not many people or jobs so it was inevitable that we would end up working together).

About a year later I learned from Facebook that she was engaged to Tom, they got married in Zurich (our hometown) and obviously they didn't invite me even though I sent a gift anonymously.

About a year and a half later they announced that they would have their first child.

For my part, there is not a day that I do not regret what I did but I had no choice, the reason I rejected it was that despite her name Sofia is of Japanese descent on both sides and I know that my mother would never have approved our relationship (if our friendship was very begrudgingly teeth but accepted it) and I know that I should have chosen between Sofia or my Mother.

For my part, I do not hold a grudge against my mother, I know that she has her prejudices and I know that she would NEVER have approved of our relationship and my mother's happiness is more important than mine and even more knowing everything she did for me (divorced mother since I was 5 years old and with a missing ex-husband).

And, for my part, I cannot complain, when I turned 26 I decided to have children on my own and after much trouble I managed to have my twins on my own thanks to a surrogate mother and a few trips to the US, they are love of my life and I would not change them for anything in the world.

And I know that Sofia is also happy with hers and 4 her children and 1 of hers on the way and that is what matters

&lt;p&gt;After we graduated they went to live in Germany (we live in Switzerland) I learned from her best friend (who also hates me to death) that the main reason they went to Germany was that she did not want to meet me as it was inevitable because of him. field that we study (there are not many people or jobs so it was inevitable that we would end up working together).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year later I learned from Facebook that she was engaged to Tom, they got married in Zurich (our hometown) and obviously they didn&amp;#39;t invite me even though I sent a gift anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year and a half later they announced that they would have their first child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my part, there is not a day that I do not regret what I did but I had no choice, the reason I rejected it was that despite her name Sofia is of Japanese descent on both sides and I know that my mother would never have approved our relationship (if our friendship was very begrudgingly teeth but accepted it) and I know that I should have chosen between Sofia or my Mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my part, I do not hold a grudge against my mother, I know that she has her prejudices and I know that she would NEVER have approved of our relationship and my mother&amp;#39;s happiness is more important than mine and even more knowing everything she did for me (divorced mother since I was 5 years old and with a missing ex-husband).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, for my part, I cannot complain, when I turned 26 I decided to have children on my own and after much trouble I managed to have my twins on my own thanks to a surrogate mother and a few trips to the US, they are love of my life and I would not change them for anything in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I know that Sofia is also happy with hers and 4 her children and 1 of hers on the way and that is what matters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should still love my mother ?&lt;/p&gt;

You are the one I choose to wait for fortifying the once questioned dream and turning it into a possible reality.

I needed to take breakes during the writing cus I really was so moved all of a sudden and I kept thinking about all of this. I could have written more than a page, but felt like I would have never stopped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t felt love in a while and dunno if it&amp;#39;s that but I sure do know my feelings for him are always growing stronger. I struggle so much to recognise my feelings at times because of past family trauma I had. But he&amp;#39;s so important to me, I don&amp;#39;t want to let him go and I wish I didn&amp;#39;t always think that much over my feelings. But there&amp;#39;s always that inner voice in me saying &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot; to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope someone will answer me in this because again, he&amp;#39;s so important.&lt;/p&gt;

,love,"What can I say - I love her. I absolutely adore her to bits. She’s my rock, my best friend, my soulmate. When we first met a few years ago, way before we started talking, I would call her my “moral support dog” because even though we weren’t particularly close at the time, she was always kind, caring, and a shoulder to cry on, a source of comfort. We didn’t talk very often. But then recently, one of our mutual best friends set us up - and it was quite possibly the best thing that could’ve ever happened to me. She makes me u afraid. Unafraid of myself, unafraid of the world, unafraid of everything. She makes me a better person. I love her, so, so much!!

We exchange little love notes in class frequently. So, for Valentine’s Day, I thought, why not take these notes a bit further, and write each other a love letter? Unfortunately, mine arrived a bit late due to issues with the post office, but we opened them today, organising it so that we’d do it at exactly the same time - I was absolutely, utterly, just in awe of how this wonderful human is mine, and how I’m hers!! She is so thoughtful. Her letter was beautiful; she filled the main envelope with heart confetti, and then made a smaller, pastel rainbow envelope containing a gorgeous little doodle (she’s a fantastic artist too!) as well as some messages of encouragement, and then for the main letter itself, she stained it with coffee or tea or something, and burned the edges, and splattered “blood” on it (it sounds a little odd - but I’m very much a romantic, I love escapism, and it looked so beautiful to me, words don’t really do it justice). And the content of the letter - oh. My. God. She has one Hell of a way with words... it was so poetic, so fantastic, I’m melting just thinking about it!! And her reaction to the letter I sent her - priceless!! All I want right now is to give her the biggest hug possible, to hold her, squeeze her, and kiss her all over her face whilst telling her I love her more than anything.

I put that letter up on my wall. For now, it’s being held up with blu tack, however I intend to frame it. And as for the other stuff? I have some shelves above my bed, which, at the beginning of our relationship, were empty aside from a few faux plants, but have since become filled with mementos of our love. Things like little cards, the envelopes they come in, a little painting she did for me, some Sylvanian Families figures (note: she bought me these because I never got to play with them as a child, but always wanted to), and since this morning, the contents of this envelope. I sent her a picture. This was the first time I told her about these shelves - she hasn’t been in my room yet because if covid - and her reaction was too... well, I can’t think of a word which comes even close to how amazing it made me feel!! She said she was going to cry, she was so happy, so love-stricken - and I must say, it was very contagious! I’m on the verge of tears as I write this :’) holy damn. I love this girl.

I hope you recognize why I am writing this almost seven months later. It was imperative to me that my words take their own time to thaw and course upon this document naturally, as I felt a personal obligation to grant my emotions the proper closure required in order for me to move forward from this - from *us*. From *what could have been us*.

This is not going to be short. This is not going to be pretty. This is not going to be romantic or poetic. This is the pain of a broken heart. The pure essence of desire which I hold for you. The torment of an unrequited love. The ambivalence of an unfinished story.

I hold all of this and more, in my heart for you - and you only.

My infatuation over you left me in a daze. I was rotting away within the framework of a deluded fever-dream, and it wasn't your fault - it was mine. You can't *ever* control the way in which someone else responds to a situation; if they think you can - you're not the problem, *they are* \- *I was. I am.*

I am writing this letter *for you -* before my time runs out - before I realize that I'm still in love with you.

\~

I'm still in love with you. I'm in love with your eyes. Only about 2% of the world's population has green eyes. That means for every 39,000 people, just 7 of them barely get to fathom what it's like to even be *as half as* phenomenal as you are. You're more remarkable than ""one-of-a-kind."" You're outstandingly outstanding. *You're you* \- and that's the part I'm obsessed with.

I'm still in love with you. I'm in love with your strength. It resonates around you; throughout your aura. Like the soft-glow that lightning bolts give off, which occasionally become marked into the cornea. You're like that in a way. You come in and out of people's lives *so quickly* \- like ripples of lightning that whisk across the sky - by the time you're gone, you leave them scorched and thirsty for more: more of you, more of your presence, more of that blooming youth which so effortlessly accompanies you, no matter the situation. The mere impression I receive based on your presence alone is single-handedly enough of an indication that you have exclusively walked through the depths of Hell, and still came out with an opulence more ravishing than pure, golden-white starlight. To be quite frank, you could swoon the Devil himself if you damn well pleased.

I'm still in love with you. I'm in love with your hair. It’s wild, like how you form your sentences. The perfect constitution of a Wagnerian opera: your thoughts beginning at a leisurely and comprehensive pace - the subject of discussion unquestionably portrayed. Then, in a passionate fervor of words - spiraling - your tongue begins to hop and stumble over itself, while forgotten syllables dissolve into little spurts of gusto. It's almost as if you're expecting something to happen - for your voice to fizzle-out at any given moment - unless each and every single whit of thought which ambles through your mind is accurately conveyed before the ill-suited period known as a full-lung's breath comes to an end. This is what completes you though - never forget that, please.

\~

I've fallen in love with everything about you.

I've fallen in love with your tattoos. I hope you decided to watch my favorite film after I shared it with you. There's a scene with a Death's-Head Hawkmoth positioned ever so gorgeously within frame. I remember about a month after you left, you got a tattoo of one on your forearm. Sometimes I really wonder if that moth formed a connection between us; but if you've seen the film, its message is transient, fleeting, and otherworldly - such as life.

I've fallen in love with your superstitions and how you've lived a thousand lives. What is it like to die one-thousand times, to love, to take one-thousand first breaths, and one-thousand last? Tell me, does it hurt?

I've fallen in love with how you speak so many different languages that you need to count them on your fingers - *twice*, just to make sure that you got them all down.

With the way your French accent is better than perfect, it's beautiful, it's sublime - but now, I can't tell if I'm talking about the way you speak French, or the way you enunciate yourself in general. Your voice absorbs every fiber of my living being. For the love of God, you could scream and curse at me all you want, and I would still see a woman with elegance and charm comparable to that of the goddess Psyche.

You know at first, I didn't believe you when you told me that you were a ladykiller. When I think about that moment now; not a single ounce, not a single bone in my body, is doubtful that you would consciously tell a lie. Because you did something to me - and I can't stop thinking about you, or wanting to see you, or wanting to talk to you, or just even wanting to know if you exist or if you're okay.

\~

I want to feel your existence.

I want you to sing to me. In every language you know - even if what you're saying goes right over my head. I want to hear your voice crack. I want to hear you hit notes more astonishing than the lead soprano of the Palais Garnier. I want to feel the weight of your words release such an unbelievable impression upon my soul, that tears cascade down my cheeks before they even escape your mouth.

I want to go on silly dates again. Ones where we forget to check the weather, and I drive down to see you just to get stuck in 100° blazing heat that we can't do anything in - so you and I, we sit in shaded alleys, drink our cans of 99¢ green tea, and talk about Zen Buddhism and smoking weed.

I want you to teach me how to say, ""I love you,"" in as many different ways as possible. Teach me how to kiss - how to love. Teach me how to be yours, because I want to be yours.

Because I don't want to be anyone else's.

Because I won't be anyone else's.

I want to ballroom dance with you. I want to teach you how to Waltz where the brushwood clears off into a luscious grove. Where the moonlight kisses our skin colorless. Where the stars aren't afraid to grin with such exuberance, that they nearly combust into a thousand-million tiny bits of sky which are brighter than the sun. Where the planets share their secrets with the gods, and the gods turn those secrets into oracles for Plato, Alexander The Great, Isaac Newton, Gandhi... Where life transcends death. Where death transcends life. Where The Infinite is ephemeral.

\~

I've fallen in love with everything I can possibly describe about you. And I know, you probably don't remember my name - because when you asked if we could go on our first date, you asked *three separate times*... Later, I found out that you had forgotten the prior two. But that's okay; because as with all things, we must move forward and on until, once more, the sweet kiss of our familiar friend, Death, will relinquish us off our aching feet.

I have lived on this planet for longer than I can remember, and I know that you have, too. An encounter like ours is only equatable to the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn - a *rara avis*.

I wrote you this letter because *our* time is up. Our time is up, and I am still in love with you.

But you’re not here. You’re thousands of miles away in another state, and I'm not even sure if you're going to come back.

Here's to the time we spent together.

See you in the next life.

\~

You can&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; control the way in which someone else responds to a situation; if they think you can - you&amp;#39;re not the problem, &lt;em&gt;they are&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;em&gt;I was. I am.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am writing this letter &lt;em&gt;for you -&lt;/em&gt; before my time runs out - before I realize that I&amp;#39;m still in love with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still in love with you. I&amp;#39;m in love with your eyes. Only about 2% of the world&amp;#39;s population has green eyes. That means for every 39,000 people, just 7 of them barely get to fathom what it&amp;#39;s like to even be &lt;em&gt;as half as&lt;/em&gt; phenomenal as you are. You&amp;#39;re more remarkable than &amp;quot;one-of-a-kind.&amp;quot; You&amp;#39;re outstandingly outstanding. &lt;em&gt;You&amp;#39;re you&lt;/em&gt; - and that&amp;#39;s the part I&amp;#39;m obsessed with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still in love with you. I&amp;#39;m in love with your strength. It resonates around you; throughout your aura. Like the soft-glow that lightning bolts give off, which occasionally become marked into the cornea. You&amp;#39;re like that in a way. You come in and out of people&amp;#39;s lives &lt;em&gt;so quickly&lt;/em&gt; - like ripples of lightning that whisk across the sky - by the time you&amp;#39;re gone, you leave them scorched and thirsty for more: more of you, more of your presence, more of that blooming youth which so effortlessly accompanies you, no matter the situation. The mere impression I receive based on your presence alone is single-handedly enough of an indication that you have exclusively walked through the depths of Hell, and still came out with an opulence more ravishing than pure, golden-white starlight. To be quite frank, you could swoon the Devil himself if you damn well pleased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still in love with you. I&amp;#39;m in love with your hair. It’s wild, like how you form your sentences. The perfect constitution of a Wagnerian opera: your thoughts beginning at a leisurely and comprehensive pace - the subject of discussion unquestionably portrayed. Then, in a passionate fervor of words - spiraling - your tongue begins to hop and stumble over itself, while forgotten syllables dissolve into little spurts of gusto. It&amp;#39;s almost as if you&amp;#39;re expecting something to happen - for your voice to fizzle-out at any given moment - unless each and every single whit of thought which ambles through your mind is accurately conveyed before the ill-suited period known as a full-lung&amp;#39;s breath comes to an end. This is what completes you though - never forget that, please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve fallen in love with everything about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve fallen in love with your tattoos. I hope you decided to watch my favorite film after I shared it with you. There&amp;#39;s a scene with a Death&amp;#39;s-Head Hawkmoth positioned ever so gorgeously within frame. I remember about a month after you left, you got a tattoo of one on your forearm. Sometimes I really wonder if that moth formed a connection between us; but if you&amp;#39;ve seen the film, its message is transient, fleeting, and otherworldly - such as life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve fallen in love with your superstitions and how you&amp;#39;ve lived a thousand lives. What is it like to die one-thousand times, to love, to take one-thousand first breaths, and one-thousand last? Tell me, does it hurt?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve fallen in love with how you speak so many different languages that you need to count them on your fingers - &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt;, just to make sure that you got them all down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the way your French accent is better than perfect, it&amp;#39;s beautiful, it&amp;#39;s sublime - but now, I can&amp;#39;t tell if I&amp;#39;m talking about the way you speak French, or the way you enunciate yourself in general. Your voice absorbs every fiber of my living being. For the love of God, you could scream and curse at me all you want, and I would still see a woman with elegance and charm comparable to that of the goddess Psyche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know at first, I didn&amp;#39;t believe you when you told me that you were a ladykiller. When I think about that moment now; not a single ounce, not a single bone in my body, is doubtful that you would consciously tell a lie. Because you did something to me - and I can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about you, or wanting to see you, or wanting to talk to you, or just even wanting to know if you exist or if you&amp;#39;re okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to feel your existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to sing to me. In every language you know - even if what you&amp;#39;re saying goes right over my head. I want to hear your voice crack. I want to hear you hit notes more astonishing than the lead soprano of the Palais Garnier. I want to feel the weight of your words release such an unbelievable impression upon my soul, that tears cascade down my cheeks before they even escape your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to go on silly dates again. Ones where we forget to check the weather, and I drive down to see you just to get stuck in 100° blazing heat that we can&amp;#39;t do anything in - so you and I, we sit in shaded alleys, drink our cans of 99¢ green tea, and talk about Zen Buddhism and smoking weed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to teach me how to say, &amp;quot;I love you,&amp;quot; in as many different ways as possible. Teach me how to kiss - how to love. Teach me how to be yours, because I want to be yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I don&amp;#39;t want to be anyone else&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I won&amp;#39;t be anyone else&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to ballroom dance with you. I want to teach you how to Waltz where the brushwood clears off into a luscious grove. Where the moonlight kisses our skin colorless. Where the stars aren&amp;#39;t afraid to grin with such exuberance, that they nearly combust into a thousand-million tiny bits of sky which are brighter than the sun. Where the planets share their secrets with the gods, and the gods turn those secrets into oracles for Plato, Alexander The Great, Isaac Newton, Gandhi... Where life transcends death. Where death transcends life. Where The Infinite is ephemeral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve fallen in love with everything I can possibly describe about you. And I know, you probably don&amp;#39;t remember my name - because when you asked if we could go on our first date, you asked &lt;em&gt;three separate times&lt;/em&gt;... Later, I found out that you had forgotten the prior two. But that&amp;#39;s okay; because as with all things, we must move forward and on until, once more, the sweet kiss of our familiar friend, Death, will relinquish us off our aching feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have lived on this planet for longer than I can remember, and I know that you have, too. An encounter like ours is only equatable to the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn - a &lt;em&gt;rara avis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote you this letter because &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; time is up. Our time is up, and I am still in love with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you’re not here. You’re thousands of miles away in another state, and I&amp;#39;m not even sure if you&amp;#39;re going to come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s to the time we spent together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you in the next life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The girl with a mind that behaves as if it were a heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~~~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I love the language, that soft bastard Latin&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which melts like kisses from a female mouth,&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And sounds like it should be writ on satin&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With syllables which breathe of the sweet south.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beppo, Lord Byron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,love,"I really love my boyfriend and tried to write a Valentine's poem for him. It didn't turn out how I wanted and I got too shy to share it with him but here it is. 

Drifting through life

Our hearts carry expectations

Searching in others

For love, fulfillment, elation

A dream that's ever evasive

Hope for a hopeless romantic

Or a necessary salvation

A salve that heals hurts and abrasions

But then, why does my love feel abrasive

Is my failure a lack of dedication

Or needs that are too pervasive

Needs for appreciation, communication

Integration into one another's lives

Needing and needing to be needed

If love is the meeting of needs

Then I have met someone who meets mine

And so, with all that said baby

I still buy her gifts from time to time because even I know there are things that she needs, can make use of, or just wants, but I like making her feel special by giving her something that I put a lot of time, effort, and love into.

So it was just recently Valentine's and I didn't really have a lot of money to get her an amazing gift. So what I did instead was make a video wherein I compiled all of the handwritten letters and specially made gifts she gave me, and thanked her for being amazing.

Once I surprised her with it on Valentine's, I'm happy to say that she loved it and that we spent the whole day happy together. It's great knowing she still loves my surprises and the stuff I make. It's moments like that which tells me I should never stop trying to put in the effort in making my loved one happy. 

Here's the video if you guys wanna see it. You don't have to click on it if you don't want to, I just hope I got to show how important it is to make the person you love so much FEEL loved.

&lt;p&gt;So it was just recently Valentine&amp;#39;s and I didn&amp;#39;t really have a lot of money to get her an amazing gift. So what I did instead was make a video wherein I compiled all of the handwritten letters and specially made gifts she gave me, and thanked her for being amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I surprised her with it on Valentine&amp;#39;s, I&amp;#39;m happy to say that she loved it and that we spent the whole day happy together. It&amp;#39;s great knowing she still loves my surprises and the stuff I make. It&amp;#39;s moments like that which tells me I should never stop trying to put in the effort in making my loved one happy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the video if you guys wanna see it. You don&amp;#39;t have to click on it if you don&amp;#39;t want to, I just hope I got to show how important it is to make the person you love so much FEEL loved.&lt;/p&gt;

,love,"As a disclaimer: me and my boyfriend have been dating for over a year now (anniversary was in november) and this was our second Valentine’s day together. 

Today I went to see my boyfriend whom I adore because we hadn’t seen each other in a while (thanks pandemic) and since it was Valentine’s day yesterday. Because of how he is he tends to forget things easily (like appointments and dates of things etc) so he had to go to a dentists appointment while I was there. No big deal, since I can handle being on my own for a bit and have chilled with just his brother or dad when he was gone in the past. He just let me vibe with mutual friends on voice call and went on his way.

Unfortunately, probably also due to covid, the appointment was kind of rescheduled or something and he ended up having to wait 2 hours there. 
However, unbeknownst to me before he left, I was in his home (he lives at his dads with his brother) alone for that amount of time. When he told me that I kinda freaked out because I didn’t know they had so much trust in me to just, be there (I’m extremely insecure and while I wouldn’t have done anything anyways, I probably would’ve gone chilling with their dogs if I had known).

,love,"Has anybody else experienced this? What do you guys think? 

I am generally an anxious person, I was a victim of child abuse perpetrated by my step-mother, but I luckily survived and now live a generally very healthy life considering what I went through from ages 1-12 because my mother and step-father always provided me with unconditional love when I was with them (custody issues), and I’ve also been in therapy since I could talk basically. 

I am (24F) now in my first ever healthy, loving, non-toxic relationship. All my previous relationships have been projections of my trauma, which I’ve worked out, but I always knew anyway that these other guys weren’t for me. Considering my family history, my mother urges a VERY cautious view on relationships because of the trauma we both endured with divorce. Things like be together for a while, you’re never really sure about people, people change, relationships change, know there’s a possibility I could love somebody now and hate them 5 years later, be VERY CAREFUL and particular in who I give my heart and eventual hand in marriage to, etc. 

Well, I now have so much anxiety because of how much I love my boyfriend and the fact that I could see him maybe being the one. I am plagued with thoughts of the 50% divorce rate. I am plagued with the thoughts that it doesn’t matter how much we love each other, we could always break up because people and relationships change. I’m plagued with the thought that the recovery from our potential breakup would be absolutely brutal because of how deep in we are, and every time I think about how much I love him, I’m reminded of how horrible it would be if this didn’t work out. What if in 6 years, when I’m 30 and want to start settling down, things end and I have to start from scratch? 

I feel I’m conditioned to think glass half empty in terms of relationships, but I also understand why and understand it’s wise to be cautious.

every time I experience something new and exciting with my partner, like touching hands for the very first time or looking him deep into his eyes or telling him I love him yada yada, I get this heavy buzzing in my ears for like 1-3 seconds.

it's like I'm literally able to hear the blood coming up to my head and it's making me feel like I'm paralyzed, unable to do anything in this moment. it's rather loud and it feels intoxicating, but it's not like I don't like it, I've just been wondering if there are other people out there experiencing the same thing or if there's something wrong with my body.

I remember hearing this intense vibration with my first boyfriend as well when I was 13/14, so it's not like it's new to me - it's just that I'm kinda confused because I thought it was a normal thing everyone else experienced as well.

,love,"I love you,' Buttercup said. 'I know this must come as something of a surprise to you, since all I've ever done is scorn you and degrade you and taunt you, but I have loved you for several hours now, and every second, more.

 I thought an hour ago that I loved you more than any woman has ever loved a man, but a half hour after that I knew that what I felt before was nothing compared to what I felt then. But ten minutes after that, I understood that my previous love was a puddle compared to the high seas before a storm. 

Your eyes are like that, did you know? Well they are. How many minutes ago was I? Twenty? Had I brought my feelings up to then? It doesn't matter.' Buttercup still could not look at him. The sun was rising behind her now; she could feel the heat on her back, and it gave her courage. 

'I love you so much more now than twenty minutes ago that there cannot be comparison. I love you so much more now then when you opened your hovel door, there cannot be comparison. 

There is no room in my body for anything but you. My arms love you, my ears adore you, my knees shake with blind affection. My mind begs you to ask it something so it can obey. Do you want me to follow you for the rest of your days? I will do that. Do you want me to crawl? I will crawl. I will be quiet for you or sing for you, or if you are hungry, let me bring you food, or if you have thirst and nothing will quench it but Arabian wine, I will go to Araby, even though it is across the world, and bring a bottle back for your lunch. Anything there is that I can do for you, I will do for you; anything there is that I cannot do, I will learn to do. 

I know I cannot compete with the Countess in skills or wisdom or appeal, and I saw the way she looked at you. And I saw the way you looked at her.

&lt;p&gt;Just once, I&amp;#39;d like to see a movie about a couple who&amp;#39;s already been together for a while, has kids and a stressful job. And the whole movie is told through a series of flashbacks about how they&amp;#39;ve made it work in they&amp;#39;re hectic lives.&lt;/p&gt;

Pretty neat that I found this subreddit right? The flair actually says 'to my love' omg this is the perfect place for me to gush whether im sober or not while I do it :))) anywayss let's get to today's letter because today is the day the world celebrates love and this is perfecttt. 

This is the first Valentine's Day where I could finally ask someone the age old, cheesy question ""will you be my valentine?"" and I'm so glad it was you. Thank you for making the last 3 months a lot less lonely and heaps more fun. I've been able to pull through because you've been there to listen to every rant and sad moment, and I know there are a lot of those and let's not forget, the spicy moments too. You've made me feel loved and valued and I hope that this post does the same for you, because we both know how much you like a love letter. 

I know you're gonna beat yourself up for the next few weeks and months because we won't be able to talk as much but I just want you to know I value every moment you make for us so much. I'll try to keep it together a bit these next few months. (totally don't have tears in my eyes right now)  

I often think about all the ways I would shower you with my affections if I had the means and \*claps hands together\* I have so many cute couple ideas, like hella cheesy but so cute. ahh I just love you so much and I feel so so lucky that you love someone like me. Oooft.. here come the water works again, jeez. I think of you every moment and I get so many happy fluttery feelings. 

I'm sorry in advance for all the times when my mind will make me feel bad about myself and for how much I'll hurt you when that happens and I just hope that you'll stick with me despite all that. I just hope the next 3 months whiz by like the last 3 so that we can be closer than ever. You'll have to see my crusty face on FaceTime lol, enjoyyy.  

I don't have much else to say right nowww other than, I love you so much, happy 3 months, happy Valentine's Day and... I love waking up to your emails in the morning so please keep sending them :) Honestly I could go on for another hundred words about the morning scramble to refresh my email to see what you sent, my eyes like barely open and my mind is like ""must... open... gmail...AH THE LIGHT!""  (lol I'm funny) 

I hope this made you smile, my love.

,love," Never in my life have I been in love or felt any feeling related to it, and I am beginning to think love is just another extinct concept that society likes to overrate. But I read a lot and there is something I would like you to know.  
Only once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you’ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved, and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can’t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy, or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song, or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind, or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting, and worthwhile. Your only hope and security are in knowing that they are a part of your life. When this time comes, please take it, because after, your life may not make sense to you anymore

,love,"I understand tomorrow is Valentine's Day, but since our one-year anniversary is close too, we're combining celebrating a mix of both next weekend. We see each other every 2 weeks, but he calls me daily lately for a bit just to check-in. He called to ask if I was feeling okay after being vaccinated, and I said my arm is just sore.

We talked about our day, and he asked if it was strange that we weren't spending time together tomorrow. I said no, and I talked about my issue with Valentine's Day. He wanted to make sure ""because some girls seem to blah blah blah,"" and some of his friends ask if he's still with me. I mean, I was the one who said let's not celebrate on Valentine's Day. We talked about last year's Valentine's Date which was super romantic at a nice restaurant and we dressed up.

It was supposed to be a casual phone call, but I apologized. My bf was confused, and he asked what was I apologizing for? I talked about how I know I'm a little different from past relationships we both experienced, and I don't spend a lot of time with him. He said that was fine, but I also added the bit that I understand it gives off the wrong message to his social friends who seem to wonder and joke about whether he's still with me. My friends typically don't joke around about that stuff because they know this is just my personality, and I find it so liberating to be able to do things outside of the relationship. But I acknowledged it may not have been what HE wanted.

He cut me off and said this relationship has been such a breathe of fresh of air (or something like that). I know earlier on in the relationship, he has said he wrongly thought he wanted a gf that was clingy and super attached to him. I love and miss him, but we both have busy schedules and hobbies. I remember before corona, I sat with some of his friends while my bf said he found someone that he genuinely feels happy with. And then on the phone today he said honestly, when his friends aren't joking around, they mention how much happier my bf seems. Of course I make my bf happy. Why else would he stay? But, it was really heartwarming to hear. He makes me happy too.

I will happily look forward to next week since I heard he wrote a card (we write super long cards sometimes) and has some things he needs to set up.

,love,"Today is my birthday and I did not expect much. But I did bake a cake for myself to celebrate it. My family never celebrate birthdays so it didn't matter to me.

But then comes my amazing girlfriend. Last night, during our video call, she stayed with me till 12am to wish me. It wasnt much but I was already happy that she wished me happy birthday.

Then morning comes, I was busy decorating my cake. Suddenly a notification pops up from my phone. It was a tweet from my girlfriend. I thought she tweeted something like ""I hate the fact that I'm so bad with words"" as a way she felt guilty or something idk. I couldnt see the whole tweet from notification so I thought it was that. Then I opened it, turns out she made a birthday appreciation tweet with a picture of us together saying she loves me so much!!!! I was REALLY happy. I thought it could not get any better than this. It was too sweet for me.

But then, as we were video calling each other a few hours ago, suddenly I got a call from a express delivery service saying they have something for me. I was perplexed. But I sorta guessed what it was. It was a gift from my girlfriend!! 😂

It had so many things in it. Even a shirt I wanted. Funny pictures of her. A thermos. A teddy bear. Some weird but cute headwear. A notebook full of surprises. A keychain. Lots of heart origamis. And a super duper sweet birthday card.

I really want to be with you for the rest of my life, and I hope we can grow older and become better for each other together. I will always try my best for you because you mean more to me than anything else ever has and I can’t risk losing you.

,love,"He (25M) came to meet me (25M) after I got off work so that we could go sit at the beach together for a little bit. When he arrived, we met, hugged, and started off right away towards my car, but I had parked a couple of blocks down, so we had time to catch up and chat while we walked. I don't even remember now what I had been talking about, but I was going on about *something* when we approached my car, and I kept talking as we both sat down and closed the doors.

I was focusing on getting settled into the driver's seat, still prattling on, but when I finally glanced back over at him, I faltered and was suddenly quiet. He had pulled his mask down to his chin, leaned over the center console, and was beaming that impossibly warm, sweet smile of his, gazing in a way at me that I can only describe as plainly adoring. And when I noticed him, all he said in a cutesy voice was, ""Kiss. :)""

Laughing, I threw myself willingly into him, but only kissed him very briefly *because* I was laughing. As I broke away, I exclaimed in mock frustration, ""God, how are you so fucking precious!"" as he snickered delightedly.

Taking a big breath and settling down, I made one final statement to wrap up whatever I'd been saying a moment before (because apparently it was that important). Then, turning back towards him, I said, ""Alright, let me give you a real kiss, though..."" And after stealing a long, lazy moment to *really* take each other in, we pulled away grinning like fools at one another and hummed in contented agreement that, okay, yeah, *that* was a little more what we had needed.

,love,"I love you so much it’s actually beyond me. You challenge me to feel rather than to exhibit emotion. I am not consciously aware of how it is I am “feeling” (such a terrible term as what I am referring to is emotion since feeling and emotion are two different things). Everything I experience when I am with you is subconscious. They just flow freely and effortlessly. But given our current situation, I am inclined to think what it is I’m experience is wrong? I’m not sure. We’re not together and though that bugs me sometimes, most of the other times I’m actually okay bc I myself am not ready for a relationship in that I’m not fully at my whole self yet.

Slowly I’m coming to an understanding of why it is what you chose to do what you did. I respect it. Granted sometimes I think about why it couldn’t be done while being together but the freedom of not being in anything is quite a fresh air. 

I guess that’s why I enjoy the idea of putting no labels to whatever it is we’re doing. (I know the idea of it is we’re doing but labels in my option are very limiting. Perhaps it’s the bullshit in me) It allows me to be free flowing. 

I enjoy the fuck out of my time with you. I know you’ve stated the same but it’s hard to believe when you’re surrounded by people so much more similar to you. I guess to come out of it I’m just not gonna think about it and enjoy life as it goes. Sometimes it’s important to take a moment and enjoy what you have in front of you. Thinking future with nothing on hand is frustrating and we’re so young. 

If life allows it, we’ll come together and if it doesn’t then well it was nice while it lasted (even though I really want it to work out that way but nothin can be forced). I’m way too zen rn and maybe ideas will change but this is where I am right now: happy, blissful and mellow. It’s has been a looooooong time since I felt this way and I won’t take it for granted.

,love,"To dating me. Don't want to give off the wrong idea, we aren't married (yet). I just want to share the story about how I found the love of my life and we actually wound up together instead of her becoming ""the one that got away."" So, where else to start but at the beginning?

She is the sister of one of my good friends, so I have known her since I was 11. It wasn't until I was 16 that I got feelings for her. After a particularly rough few relationships in that 5-year-period, I had hardened myself and decided that I won't date anybody until college! Then, one of my buddies asked me ""what's your type?"" I hadn't thought about it since I closed my heart off, but almost miraculously, a thought came to mind which flashed an image of something I saw on Facebook the night prior. I hurriedly found the picture and showed it to my friend as the bell rang and said ""she's the embodiment of my type, but I'll probably never get close to her."" Hehe, I was in for a shock. A few months go by and she goes on a school trip that I am also going on (so we're about 40 other people), and that is when I knew she was the one. During that trip, I saw her in a certain light, and I just knew I had to try to be with her - otherwise I'd be depriving myself of happiness.

So, now that I knew she was the one, I tried desperately to see her, talk to her, get close to her, and do everything I could just to be with her. We hung out so much that we quickly formed a bond that neither of us had before with anybody else. Although, she hadn't come around to the idea of dating me just yet. I was a senior, she was a freshman, so although we spent that whole year together, we never started dating. I asked her out a couple times and got rejected, but I was still just happy to be with her. I wanted more than just a friendship, but a friendship was better than nothing, y'know? Then, I moved away to college. I thought that my chances with this girl of my dreams was over.

While at college, I shared this tale with pretty much anybody who would listen. One girl at college was particularly impacted by my love story, and she wanted to date me. I figured this new girl would be a nice way to get over my high school sweetheart, so I gave it a shot. I came home for Thanksgiving and caught up with a lot of my high school friends, and she was there. I told her I wasn't doing very well in chemistry this semester, which was odd for me since I was a straight A student in high school.

""Maybe you don't have someone to try for anymore.""

When she said that to me, it opened my eyes. I knew that, even though she was still in high school and I was in college, I couldn't give up on her. I got back up to college and told my girlfriend-at-the-time that I just couldn't feel for her the way she deserved, because somebody else had my heart. She understood and I rededicated myself to my crush of 3 years. I messaged her, spent my whole winter break with her, mailed her letters and memes, we had so much fun. In the summer, I finally buckled down.

The summer of 2019, I came home from college and resolved myself to ask her out once more and if she said no, I would finally move on. I tried waiting for the perfect moment, and I spent months figuring out how I should do it. When I finally had everything in place, several things went wrong. I couldn't get her alone, she was sad because of a video game character death, and she started thrashing me at monopoly. Finally, at about midnight, she best me in monopoly and I got her alone. I told her that after all this time, I still had feelings for her and asked if she wanted to go out with me.

""Fine.""

""What was that?""

""I'll go out with you.""

""Then it's a deal.""

I shook her hand and left her house for the night, still not entirely sure that I was conscious. Since then, we are still together and happier than ever. I'm in my third year of college, she's in her senior year of high school, and we've been talking about what our future house is gonna look like. COVID times were hard, but we made it through without a scratch. When we reminisce about the days when I chased her, I apologize for being too persistent, she apologizes for not giving me a shot (she often wishes we got together earlier because I make her happy. I share that sentiment). Sorry for the super long post, but I just love this love story and that it has come into reality.

&lt;p&gt;I shook her hand and left her house for the night, still not entirely sure that I was conscious. Since then, we are still together and happier than ever. I&amp;#39;m in my third year of college, she&amp;#39;s in her senior year of high school, and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about what our future house is gonna look like. COVID times were hard, but we made it through without a scratch. When we reminisce about the days when I chased her, I apologize for being too persistent, she apologizes for not giving me a shot (she often wishes we got together earlier because I make her happy. I share that sentiment). Sorry for the super long post, but I just love this love story and that it has come into reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - After 3 years of trying to get with the girl of my dreams, we finally got together, and have been together for over 18 months since!&lt;/p&gt;

,love,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year. In fact, we complete one year today. Never did I ever imagine I might be his friend, let alone girlfriend. I remember when I was falling in love with him but just couldn't identify the feeling back then. But even after one year, I keep loving him more and more every passing day. I haven't met him for 11 months due to COVID-19. Sure, we have had our ups and downs but we managed to hold each other through it all.

I miss that I haven't touched him for nearly a year now. I miss his presence, the safety he makes me feel and the sheer love I feel myself swimming in. I know I am certainly not the only one to feel this special or this sad, but I think it's worth sharing?

I love that he's very clever and has a wonderful sense of humour. With me, he evolved to learn how to love. With him, I evolved to learn how to love without breaking myself. He's the healthiest presence my life has ever had. He's the only boyfriend of mine who has ever felt right, none of the others have. Hell, he's the only person I have kissed and instead of being ashamed my first kiss was at 19, I am proud of myself for never having kissed anyone except the man of my dreams.

Fun fact - We're a real life replica of Jake and Amy from Brooklyn 99. I'm exactly an Amy and he's a Jake and it's sometimes creepy how we're so similar to a tv couple. It feels cute, not gonna lie. 

I am really delighted that we finished a year together. And I will be just as excited even after fifty, sixty years together.

,love,"my grandma and grandpa are the only example i have of true love and i think their relationship is beautiful.
this story is going to sound so cliche

they met at work, it was supposed to be my grandpas last week at the job on the week my grandma started at the same workplace after a brief conversation with her he decided he wouldn’t leave just yet.

my 19yo grandma already had a 2 year old son (my dad) who shed been raising in a flat with her mum and sisters and she also had had a daughter who had to be given up for adoption due to circumstances. she was very poor and lived in government housing her whole life. my grandpa was rather well off and at the time he would of been expected to go for someone of a higher class nevertheless he was starstruck by my grandma.

he fell for her really quickly and when they got together my grandma did not want another child due to past circumstances and my grandpa did not mind because he said loving her was more important then a child. together they raised my dad and my grandma told me she fell more for my grandpa each day, when my dad was 12 my grandma decided she wished to have a child with my grandpa and they did.

my grandpa never treated his son and my dad differently and he loved my dad as if he were his own. 
eventually my grandmas daughter came into our lives as we were grown up and still even tho she wasn’t his daughter he loved her as if she was because of how much he loved my grandma. 

they’ve been together almost 50 years now and everyday i watch them fall more for eachother. 
my grandpa tells her she’s beautiful everyday as he kisses her on the head and she always makes sure his pills are out and cooks his meals.

theres so many little details i could tell you that show their love but id be here all day, i hope one day i find someone who will love me no matter my past or circumstances like my grandpa did my grandma",t2_a64i1yzh,False,,0,False,my grandparents,[],r/love,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_liiejp,False,light,0.86,,public,5,1,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},what I think love is,False,5,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1613186183.0,text,6,,,text,self.love,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;my grandma and grandpa are the only example i have of true love and i think their relationship is beautiful.

,love," Here is a quick walkthrough for connecting with strangers in most situations, how this could lead to dates or romantic connections.

\#1: Mindset: The biggest hurdle for most people is we think of other people as “strangers” and not “friends we haven’t met yet.” While obviously it’s not good to trust anyone we see, I think many people especially in Western countries take this WAY too far and we are at odds with everyone around us, even if we are pretending to be friendly on the surface. This takes baby steps but it involves literally training your thoughts when you see new people.

\#2: Start Saying Hello To Everyone: This is another “baby step” and it means no-commitment-required saying “hi” to people who pass by. Now you’ve gone from identifying people as “not strangers” to actually communicating with them, and that’s a huge step. This exercise is more for “you” to get better at connecting with people than to “score a date” or any other external goal.

\#3: Frequent the Same Places: Now you want to be a regular in the same places, so the people you say “Hi” to all the time now feel they KNOW you because they always see you at the same coffee shop location, or wherever it may be. When people see you around the same location a lot, it builds an instant camaraderie that’s hard to explain. Now it’s very easy to segway that into…

\#4: Build Active Social Life: What you want to do is create activities that people you know, or meet, are doing together. The easiest and simplest example is a hiking group on Meetup.com, a Facebook group, whatever it is, the point is to bring people together that you meet. In the context of dating, this is very effective because it creates a NO pressure social activity with someone, involving other people. From that point, it’s a lot to do with knowing how to build that connection with someone on a romantic level. But if you’re just looking for friends (which is also a key to meeting people romantically), then this shouldn’t even require any thought.

These are actually short synopses, I talk in front of the camera and explain these steps in a lot more detail at my video about this. The link is here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4uuZT9pNI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4uuZT9pNI)

I just wanted to let you know that I developed an app for me and my partner to be able to share, just between us two, pictures of memories we have together, for instance all the photos about our trip to London. I didn't find any app like this before where the pictures would be synced between me and my partner device so I made it, of course with total privacy in mind.

Also the app has a couple more nice features for a couple like: tracking how many days you have been together, next important dates and reminder of special memories.

I didn't realize there was a Tinder subreddit. I guess there's a subreddit for just about everything though. As the title says, my wife and I got married thanks to Tinder! We where both feeling like there wasn't much left in life before we met. I actually didn't swipe on her on purpose, I always just randomly swiped. I had actually stopped using Tinder though, but I checked it one day and I had a message from her. We hit it off really quick! We're both pretty weird people and we where talking about weird stuff. After awhile I asked her if she wanted to go out, and she said yes. We actually went camping (yeah, romantic I know, but I was already going camping). She came camping with us and we just feel in love instantly. We kissed on the first night and we both just knew that we wanted to be with each other forever. She actually even threw up from drinking on out first night, and to me, that was the most romantic thing I've ever seen lol. We moved really fast, I actually moved in with her the next day. (Love at first sight is a real thing people). We just somehow knew we where meant to be. After awhile of being together we got our own place together. Then in May of last year we got married! We had only been together for about 4 or 5 months. After we got married things got hard for us. We decided to move away from everyone and everything to start our own lives. It was fine at first, but we became homeless. We where living in our car for awhile, but she stuck with me through it all. Most people go on Honeymoons after they get married, we became homeless. After struggling for awhile we finally got an amazing blessing. Our current landlord gave us a break and helped us get up on our feet and into a house. We've been in this house for about 6 months now. Being homeless really made us grow even closer to each other. We're at this point where we are ready to start a family. We've talked about it and we both agree that we want to have a baby! It just blows my mind how much has happened in a year. This time last year I was living with my friend rotting away. Now I'm happily married with goals and dreams! We're both still trying to save up to go on our Honeymoon though. We actually want to go to NYC (Romantic, I know.) We're both foodies though and we want to eat a lot of food in NYC. We're hoping to go by the end of this year, but we're still sorta struggling so we don't know if it's going to be possible.

,love,"It's difficult but its not impossible. To think that love can't be noticed within a fleeting moment. Only 10 minutes into one of the most profoundly enjoyable moments of my life. Looking down at you just to see your eyes with that piercing gaze. A smile that could melt the largest of glaciers. Eyes that leveled my very soul to the ground.

I think about the first time we met for there was no gossip, no lies, no secondhand communication. It was the first time I was finally honest. To admit to you that the world was a maze full of temptation and sin. I know for certain, had I not died, realized who I was, or found a joy that was just in the I alone, I would never have met you.

Looking back on the day I was living far from home. Full-time responsibility, living alone with a life that I'd felt denied me every opportunity to find my purpose. That I couldn't have even the simplest but beautiful dreams. Visiting my home town, I knew something was calling me back. I didn't belong in the city, I'd belonged at home. If only to receive what my life was missing for so long. Hope and faith that my simplest but most desired dreams would come true. To have meaning and to find someone to share it with.  


To treat you as a human being, not an object. To kiss you as if it could be the last. I'd thought I was out of hell when we met. Only then did I realize love got me to escape velocity. Not painless by any stretch of the imagination. I stood strong and knew deep down that we'd meet again. No matter the ridicule, lies, or outright deceit that separated us. Only through that word Marriage was a able to break those barriers. Because it was that week I knew, you were the one. Who knew what should've been the most beautiful of questions was shaped into the sharpest of spears.

Love sure as hell, drives you made. Because it's love that makes you realize all the suffering is worth the fight. A fight I won't stop until the lies hault, the lust ends, and my truth revealed. I no longer play their game and I wish you would to. Only time will tell. Or did my dream tell me, when we sat by oceanside, hand in hand, with no fear. I have none anymore. I just fear for your safety after having realize what separated us. A simple lie with the intent to put you in fear of my name.

i  used to tell her about my depression and loneliness and she used to suggest me in last year but after meeting in December she just changed

My life has been full of Lack of love

My father used to beat me without any reason and I also got a scar on my face due to him ( bite scar permanent)

My mom and sister never hugged me but they are supportive towards my father

I got a gf recently in 2019 but we broke up in a year after physical relationships

What should I do 

I don't see any other girl around my own age nearby

I just needed a hug from my childhood crush but she has changed 

I can't focus on anything my studies my work my body anything 

I am just wasting my time

Everything is reminding about her

And she doesn't seem any interested in me now

,love,"The world is experiencing a “Loneliness Epidemic.” According to Our World in Data, “if we compare two individuals of the same age – one today and another one a generation ago – we would find that the one today is more likely to feel lonely.” (ourworldindata.org)

If I never have felt this immense feeling of loneliness in the past myself, I would never understand how heartbreaking it is to experience it. When we feel lonely, we feel empty, dark, and unwanted. It causes depression. It makes us shy away from love and dating. It affects our love life and, as a result, we end up with even more loneliness.

According to my own experience, here are some self-talks or limiting beliefs that keep us from being in love, keep us single or keep us unhappy in our existing relationships.

1. I do not have a perfect body. Women prefer men with big muscles, men prefer women who look like models.
2. I do not have a good career. Attractive men or attractive women prefer people with glorious careers.
3. I do not have enough money. People are attracted to money. They might not respect me if I do not have money.
4. I need to sacrifice a lot. I need to do things that I do not like.
5. They will not have my best interest at heart. Everyone is selfish.
6. I will start dating when I have more money and a good career.
7. I got hurt last time. It is painful to experience a breakup.
8. I do not need to put much effort. If it is meant to be, it will happen.
9. I do not have time for a relationship. It is a waste of time.
10. I am totally fine being alone. I do not need anyone.
11. Mutual love does not exist in this world. I have never seen a successful relationship.
12. Maybe I'm not good enough for a good relationship.
13. I am not good at relationships.
14. There is no one that I can trust.
15. I cannot have it all. It is not possible to have a successful career and be in a good relationship at the same time.
16. I cannot be myself if I am in a relationship.
17. Whenever I get close to someone, I am left heartbroken.
18. I am too old to find love.
19. I am sure there is someone for everyone but it is so hard to find that person.
20. What if they leave me again? It is better to remain single.
21. Everything ends anyway, so what’s the point?
22. All the good ones are already taken.
23. I might need to trade my autonomy and freedom.
24. What if I am settling? What if there is someone even better or perfect?
25. I always attract the wrong person.
26. I am too old for a relationship. I have a physical ailment. I have a skin problem, I have a heart problem. No one will love me.
27. What if they cheat on me?
28. Everyone annoys me. They do not know what they are doing — so I’ll end up disappointed anyway.
29. I cannot show my partner that I need him/her, because that is a sign of weakness.
30. I always need to keep myself rational. I need to speak perfectly and act perfectly in a relationship, and that is exhausting.

The whole point is to understand above mentioned unconscious beliefs are not 100% true.

,love,"Dear Darling, 

  I’m writing this at 1:33 am with an energy I can’t quite explain. I took a nap the other day imagining your arms around my waist and the idea that one day I will finally feel safe in the presence of another person. I don’t plan to make this letter gushy, as I am sure the letters I’ve already written and will write you once we’ve met will take care of that but I do plan to tell you that our love is timeless. I used to think that romantic love was pointless in the presence of love from friends and family, but then I got older and realized that no one will understand me in the way that you do. Though both are equally important, the understanding that exists between two people is what truly makes love worth its wait. You are worth the wait. I’m writing my second book and a few days ago I had the epiphany that maybe every love poem and every short story I’ve ever written, was just my heart’s way of calling out to you and begging you to come home. 

   I’ve been yearning quite a lot these past few nights and I can only assume it’s because you’re looking for me too; please don’t stop. Even though I plan to live my life in a solitary way (as I am an introvert which you’ll know) and stay in a cottage at the edge of a bluff with no people around, I long for the day that I look into your eyes and finally remember what home feels like. And if for some reason you choose a soul tie to settle with, if for some reason you don’t come home to me, I will not scorn you or wish ill will upon you. A part of me, my soul maybe just wants the best for you and wants you to receive the love you should as the person you are right now. I do not know you yet, but I know that when I do I will not say “nice to meet you” when I shake your hand, instead I will say “what took you so long?”. So I will work on myself, and give love, and spread as much positivity as possible to heal this earth we’ve inhabited with the hope that one day I’ll receive the one person who will truly remind me of humanity’s beauty. 

Sincerely,
your love

&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this at 1:33 am with an energy I can’t quite explain. I took a nap the other day imagining your arms around my waist and the idea that one day I will finally feel safe in the presence of another person. I don’t plan to make this letter gushy, as I am sure the letters I’ve already written and will write you once we’ve met will take care of that but I do plan to tell you that our love is timeless. I used to think that romantic love was pointless in the presence of love from friends and family, but then I got older and realized that no one will understand me in the way that you do. Though both are equally important, the understanding that exists between two people is what truly makes love worth its wait. You are worth the wait. I’m writing my second book and a few days ago I had the epiphany that maybe every love poem and every short story I’ve ever written, was just my heart’s way of calling out to you and begging you to come home. &lt;/p&gt;

,love,"So I’ve been in a couple of really crappy relationships. And I recently started getting closer with a coworker from my old work and texting more. We went out for coffee last week and are trying to make plans for this upcoming sunday. But I just had to acknowledge how caring this guy is even without us being exclusive yet. I had food poisoning all day yesterday and he came over after he was off with chocolates, a premade meal for me to eat whenever I’m feeling better and some anime so I could watch something while basically living on my couch so I’m closer to the restroom. He even stayed all night just to make sure I was ok and rubbed my back while we watched the anime together.

I know we’re not officially together due to his schooling but he treated me better in one night than I was treated in a four year long relationship. I’ve never been given a gift before, not randomly without asking for it first. He knew the exact chocolates I liked because I mentioned it in passing once months ago. I just can’t believe a man exists that’s this unselfishly caring.
