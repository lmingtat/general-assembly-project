###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,False,,1,False,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_doqwow,False,dark,1.0,,public,2318,254,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2318,,True,,False,,[],"{'gid_1': 10, 'gid_2': 1}",,True,,1572389522.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;

I'm just tired from being angry all the time. I want an outlet. 

I wish this pandemic never happened. I'd still be in my home city, would've had a proper final year of highschool and would be able to meet up with my friends in the 4 months we have left before uni. 

Basically thanks to the wonderfully hellish combination of depression, anxiety and ADHD, I struggled like hell with the last few years of highschool and majorly fucked up my grades. I've been trying and busting my ass off to do whatever I can to get average grades at the very least for my final exams, which has been insanely tough to do since I used to be a straight A student until sophomore year. My parents are pissed, they don't support me in the slightest because ""mental health is not real and you just need to try harder"". 

My dad knows that my friends and dogs are the 2 things he can hold over my head and I'll do anything to not lose them; they're honestly what's keeping me somewhat mentally stable, and the reason I didn't kill myself sooner. He's never exploited that until recently though. I'm not allowed to go out or do anything fun, if I call them too often I get scolded for being on my phone too much. If I refuse to do something he wants, all I hear is ""I have people ready to take the dogs away, you want me to do it?"" 

I asked why I'm so restricted when I'm officially done with school and I have limited time left in my home city before I have to go back and the response was ""we're not happy with your academics, so we don't think you should be out enjoying"". 

What difference does it fucking make? There's literally nothing I can do to change what's already done. If I fucked up, I'll be miserable when the results come out whether or not I had fun after my exams ended. And if I did well, I'll be miserable about how much I missed out on. 

Every scenario ends in me being miserable. I can't spend time with the people I love no matter how much I want to. Even if I could take solace in having a great academic career, that's not happening because I can't get the help I need in order to do so.

,depression,"I have no friends, my parents don't care. I just feel lethargic and foggy brained the whole day. I can't study, I'm failing everything at college. Everytime I try to share anything with anyone I just wind up feeling like a stupid, whiny brat. Why should anyone care about me when I have never tried to be there for them when they need me? I'm just a selfish piece of garbage. There are things I used to enjoy like music and art but I just realised I suck at everything I do. I wish I could do something important for the world, I've tried to take an interest in science and economics but I'm too unintelligent to do anything. I'm scared l'll never find a job and will be stuck relying on my parents and feeling like a burden forever. There is no one I can turn to for guidance or support, I feel like I have to do everything on my own. I have no interest in romantic relationships but maybe I just say that to myself to cope with the fact that no one likes me.

,depression,"My pathetic story will probably bore you to tears, I know it does me. I’m only posting it here because I have to release the poison somehow. If you can’t stand pity parties read elsewhere.

I’m 61 years old. I’ve never been married. Really only ever had one serious relationship with a woman, and that was 45 years ago as a kid. The term that entered the English language “Incel” hurts more than you know.

I’ll attempt to boil it down to the bare minimum. Me as a 16-year old kid truly loved my 15-year old girlfriend. She said she loved me. We were heading into the last few years and had been talking about marriage and kids once we graduated.

Then a POS 21-year old told her he loved her and within minutes she throws me under the bus and they’re fucking in his truck. The next day she sits me down, lies that she didn’t give up her virginity the night before, and says she wants to see both of us.

Let’s see: Tall, lanky, 16-year old high school sophomore against a good looking, athletic, 21-year old man with a truck and a job and money, not to mention he’d popped her cherry just 14 hours previous. I wonder if she thought I’d go for it and if she even wanted me to. I think she knew I’d go ballistic (which I did, I’m proud to say) and just wanted to assuage her guilt over her betrayal by telling herself that I was the one who walked away, not her.

A few days later I’m driving past her house with forlorning and a broken heart, and in one of my life’s many cruel jokes my POS car breaks down. I’m on the opposite site of town and there was no such thing as mobile phones, so I swallow hard and go inside to use her parent’s phone to call a tow truck. While I wait I pussy out and start crying like a two year old that if she wouldn’t take me back, couldn’t we at least be friends.

Even today it makes me want to puke.

So I dutifully accepted my new Cuck status, remained “friends” on the surface and attempted to move on. Come to find out she spent the remainder of high school as a pariah because even people I never meet knew what a slut she was and how she mercilessly fucked me over.

Good! The bitch deserved it.

The POS and she get married, have a son, he physically, mentally, and emotionally abuses her, and she finally buys a clue a divorces his ass when her mother walks in and catches him blowing their 8-year old son.

I live my life, serve in the Gulf War, get a degree, get engaged, has the engagement broken off (thank God!) and live a lonely life begging God to tell me what I did to piss Him off. In the meantime, she burns her way through two more loser assholes.

Then I move to a city I love. Get a good job with good pay at a company that I love. I’m still lonely as fuck but everything else is coming up roses.

About a month ago (I can hear you saying, “Thank God he finally got to the problem!”) I’m blowing chunks worse than the drunken nights in the Navy ever were, and because it’s what you do in the 21st century, I posted a simple post on Facebook about how I felt sick at that particular moment.

She sees it because I friended her like the cuck Incel loser that I am, and she direct messages me to check on me. That was a month ago. There has not been a day between then and now where we have not messaged or talked on the phone. I realized that I hadn’t moved on like I thought and my heart reverts back to that time 45 years ago when I hopelessly loved her. It took some strength, but I forgave her for her betrayal because she was just a kid when it happened and she now calls her ex-husband the BSD because that’s all he is to her now: The biological sperm donor that produced their child.

Because she’s been hurt repeatedly and because there’s 500 miles between us, I try my best, which wasn’t very good, to take things slow and not pressure her. Behind the scenes I examined my situation and decided is a great job with a great company in a great city enough of a life devoid of love? I’m not going to be alive that much longer, I wanted to have an extremely slim chance at love before I die. So like the imbecilic pussy I am I begin to make plans to give up my good life to move back to my piece of shit home town for a chance at just dating her. Like that was ever going to happen!

A few hours ago she calls me out saying she thinks I’m expecting too much too soon. Fair enough. I was kinda losing my perspective on the situation. I could dial it back and try to salvage whatever it was we were doing. I can play the long game.

Then she accuses me of being a homophobe, (her son, molested by her pedophile ex husband turned out gay) and while I, myself, cannot fathom the homosexual acts￼, I’ve never once indicated I’ll will toward her son or any homosexual man. My creed is live and let live. I’ve never been given the authority of telling other people how to live their lives.

And then she just disappears. Like walking away from a conversation you don’t want to continue, she just drifted away to leave me defending myself against nobody.

Because of these events I’m not using Facebook anymore and I don’t know that I ever will. I’ll continue to shuffle my feet in my lonely existence until one day I suffer a heart attack and die, and if I’m lucky someone from my office will notice me missing and send the cops to do a welfare check before my corpse starts to smell.

If I have to spend one more night knowing that no one in the world gives two shits about me. I hope my heart stills in the middle of the night and this fucked up carnival I call my life comes to a close, and I don’t have to find enough strength in the morning to get out of bed, clock in, and pretend I’m okay when I’m dying inside.",t2_zbky6,False,,0,False,I hope I don’t wake up tomorrow,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_m1okek,False,dark,0.98,,public,39,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,39,,False,,False,,[],{'gid_1': 1},,True,,1615376701.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My pathetic story will probably bore you to tears, I know it does me.

&lt;p&gt;And then she just disappears. Like walking away from a conversation you don’t want to continue, she just drifted away to leave me defending myself against nobody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of these events I’m not using Facebook anymore and I don’t know that I ever will. I’ll continue to shuffle my feet in my lonely existence until one day I suffer a heart attack and die, and if I’m lucky someone from my office will notice me missing and send the cops to do a welfare check before my corpse starts to smell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I have to spend one more night knowing that no one in the world gives two shits about me. I hope my heart stills in the middle of the night and this fucked up carnival I call my life comes to a close, and I don’t have to find enough strength in the morning to get out of bed, clock in, and pretend I’m okay when I’m dying inside.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Someone made a derogatory comment about my appearance last night at dinner (I was a guest at a friend's house).

As evidenced by our media, appearance is very important as a dividing line between worthy and not worthy, and it seems I fit into the latter category unfortunately.

Now, I am confident in my skills as a quantitative analyst and programmer that I do have some value - particularly in the skills marketplace. So I can add that to my ""score"" of worthiness if you will. Also, I am a talented piano player - so I can also put that in my ""score"" of worthiness and reason to keep living. However, no matter how hard I work at these things, if there is a throughline of people looking at me and saying ""this person deserves our abuse, we should subject him to continued harrasment and demonstrate his worthlessness to him"", it's hard to calculate and counteract those deleterious signals with enough feelings of self-worth.

Thus, I learnt that posting posts on reddit does not necessarily help me. It just cannot change the situation I'm in. I do not want to trigger people, I do not want pity either.

As alays, perhaps this is an expression of the need for help. What kind of help? Even I do not know. Therapy sessions feel like pre-recorded messages are repetitively provided to me with the intent of somewhat ""calming me down"". As soon as I get helped up and out of the door, realizing my own disability and the oudside world, my simple conclusion that I'll never fit in and always feel out of place, even a little bit -- hits back, no words having changed the way this world is.

I'm sorry but having been born is not an enough reason to live. An enough reason to live would have been happy memories with family, close friends, falling in love, trying out love, finding someone who loves me and finds me perfect the way I am, getting married and having kids...

Some people may have that. Or just a thing from the list. That's more that I'll ever get. There's nothing that can flip a switch and change the memories of abuse, pain, suffering, loneliness, bullying, mockery and never being seen as enough. That's what I have up to now. No actual reason to believe something would ever change. A 26 year-old man with cerebral palsy is anything but most people's cup of tea. Other 26 year-olds need their parties, communication, fun, hikes or whatever it be. And they can get them in one way or another. Insecurity about body shape/ weight? They can do some sports/ lift weights at home. Their body would allow them to improve somewhat. This would probably make them sexy in some girl's eyes, which is a good start.

Being a successful (insert job here -- in my case, a PhD student, I suppose) has only something to do with that. As long as you have enough to live with, as long as you can somewhat do your job -- that's enough. I cannot live for my job, I am terribly sorry. I work and get paid. That's it. I cannot buy friends, love, affection, or new memories.

No reason to believe anything would change. How do I know? I've been studying and doing my best for 10 years now and nothing has changed. Me and my caretaker. That's all. And always will be.

There&amp;#39;s nothing that can flip a switch and change the memories of abuse, pain, suffering, loneliness, bullying, mockery and never being seen as enough. That&amp;#39;s what I have up to now. No actual reason to believe something would ever change. A 26 year-old man with cerebral palsy is anything but most people&amp;#39;s cup of tea. Other 26 year-olds need their parties, communication, fun, hikes or whatever it be. And they can get them in one way or another. Insecurity about body shape/ weight? They can do some sports/ lift weights at home. Their body would allow them to improve somewhat. This would probably make them sexy in some girl&amp;#39;s eyes, which is a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a successful (insert job here -- in my case, a PhD student, I suppose) has only something to do with that. As long as you have enough to live with, as long as you can somewhat do your job -- that&amp;#39;s enough. I cannot live for my job, I am terribly sorry. I work and get paid. That&amp;#39;s it. I cannot buy friends, love, affection, or new memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No reason to believe anything would change. How do I know? I&amp;#39;ve been studying and doing my best for 10 years now and nothing has changed. Me and my caretaker. That&amp;#39;s all. And always will be. Until she dies. Then... Change would come. For the worse.&lt;/p&gt;

I was with my tutor and I was trying to understand math because I’ve basically didn’t learn anything in online classes because I just spent playing games. But now covid has died down in my country, we’re going back to school and midterm are coming and I haven’t caught up with what they were teaching and now I have to copy notebooks from classmates and try to understand new content as well.

So I asked my tutor should I just quit school next week because midterm tests are coming and I don’t know anything. She said you can’t run from it forever and she’ll try to help me as much as possible that’s when I think I started crying. Idk why, maybe it was worry, maybe it was the consequences of bad grades (like colleges review your past performance and determine whether scholarship or not). I tried to calm down and finished my lesson with my tutor. 

When she walked out of home, I lay on the carpet and started sobbing then move to my bedroom. I called my therapist and told her about it, she recommended me some music to hear and say words like “I’m sorry, please forgive me, I love you, I thank you” and I tried saying them while tears are dropping. I cry so much that I can’t breathe because my nose is clogged with snot and I have to inhale and exhale through the mouth the entire time. I started yelling in my dark room like some maniac.

,depression,"Hello everyone. I hope you're as well as you can be. I'm not sure who will read this, but I haven't been able to tell anyone else in my life, so I figured I'd turn to the anonymity of the internet. If you make it through this whole thing, thank you. It feels kinda nice to write it all out.

On Saturday, after months of anguish and hard decisions, I decided to surrender my two dogs to the local humane society. I don't know anyone locally, and I'm a bad judge of character, so I figured the humane society would have better judgement and policies to make sure they find a proper home.

I surrendered them because I know that I cannot give them what they need. I have suffered from depression, anxiety, etc. for over a decade. I got these dogs to try and address these problems. Unfortunately, they alone are not enough to lift me out of myself. They got me outside to go to the bathroom, sure. But other than that? I still stayed inside most of the time. I still didn't take care of myself. And by extension, I didn't give them what they needed: more frequent baths, teeth brushing, frequent brushing, and more importantly, the love they deserve. They needed someone who could love them and play with them instead of breaking down and dissociating all the time. I did and do still love them. But it's evident that I was not the best friend they could have. I thought I could help these dogs when I adopted them: one had medical issues with his foot and hips, and the other only had one eye. And by helping them, maybe I could help myself. But I failed myself, and more importantly, failed them.

I didn't share this with anyone in my life because I knew everyone would tell me that I was wrong. They would and have told me that I am in fact a good owner. That I do care for them adequately. That they don't need for anything. But I did not want doubt to stop me from doing the right thing; getting them a better life with a better person. And I know I would have hung on if I had voices telling me lies to make ME feel better. At the expense of these beautiful dogs.

As sad and depressed as I am, I have never been a crier. I've had friends and family die, and while I am deeply sad, I have never cried for them. But when I said my goodbyes to my dogs, I couldn't stop crying. In that moment I couldn't care less who saw me bawling and I had no control. In fact, I'm shedding tears writing this right now. However, I don't think I made a mistake. I just know that I'll miss them forever. But I know they'll be in a better home.

As for where I am now, suicidal thoughts are now easier, of course. I have no plans or anything, but the thought of not being alive anymore, escaping existence... Those thoughts are there.

In fact, I&amp;#39;m shedding tears writing this right now. However, I don&amp;#39;t think I made a mistake. I just know that I&amp;#39;ll miss them forever. But I know they&amp;#39;ll be in a better home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for where I am now, suicidal thoughts are now easier, of course. I have no plans or anything, but the thought of not being alive anymore, escaping existence... Those thoughts are there. The only things that relied and depended on me are gone to a better home. No one needs me anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

She can't afford to see a therapist and has to move out soon. She hasn't cleaned her room in a while, she hasn't been taking care of herself hygiene wise and it's hard to get her out of the bed or house. We both think very differently as I'm 200% the logical thinking guy and always provides solutions instead of comfort. Depression is contagious and I feel that my confidence in being able to be strong has wavered, I question whether or not I will say the right thing that can make her feel better, I doubt myself being able to take care or support her, and I cry and get upset at myself when I accidentally make her feel worse.

I feel, and believe that I can't come to her with these emotions, as because she is depressed I can't rely on her for my own emotional support without her guilty and becoming upset at herself.

I love her with all of my heart, and for a while, I just lay in bed with her and play the games that she wants/likes and only rarely suggest in a nice, compromising way to help her clean up or take care of herself. She enjoys my company a lot and I feel that she's been demanding more than ever. I see her almost everyday, I'm 18 live with my fairly strict parents and have to go to college this fall in a different city. Every day I feel that I can't say no to her when she asks me to come over or do something because she obviously wants and needs my help but I haven't been able to work out or do my homework, or even be alone with my thoughts and correct my recent toxic thought patterns, as whenever my thoughts are with her they become self-doubting and insecure

5 days ago I went into the store for 30 minutes, came out and all 4 of my tires were slashed.No idea who or why someone would have done it. There was no one there when I arrived (no issue of I stole someone's spot or anything) and I didn't encounter anyone on the drive there (the store is less than a mile from my house.)

Then tonight I get jumped after stopping at the ATM. I guess luckily I didn't get the crap beat of me, they just shoved me down from behind off the curb and grabbed my wallet with now $100 in it and my phone and took off.

Get in my car trying to process everything that just happened, car won't start because the battery is dead. Luckily the officer that I called and filed a report to was able to jump it.

Person A, at first claimed to be bi-polar and now claims of several other disorders (all of which Doctors can not confirmed) she now says Doctors and family don't care about her. Her family have been witnessed to be very kind caring people this has been confirmed by Person B, there is also disliking between her and sister due to her sister taking a similar stance to what I have.

She does not work due to claiming being unfit to work and literally posts 7 - 10+ facebook post a day all being (apologies for the generalization) the stereotypical edgy emo teen (She is not a teen) life is hard don't judge me crap... Then you have the posts where she will claim no body cares about her and no body does anything for her Despite posting this every other day and the mountain of people trying to make sure she's ok (on and off facebook)

Person B has been obviously affected by it for a while and clearly sick of the stuff they have to put up with but goes along with it anyway. Disappears for a whole day at times and when being in a voice call with their friend group as soon as his phone rings (most of the time with an audible sigh) immediately turns off their device and claims their internet or device is playing up (despite us all hearing them press the power button). their older sister (who is a lovely person) also takes a disliking to their relationship and she knows them in a lot more detail that what information I have.

While my opinion is obviously leaning towards 1 side its still entirely private and like i said I'm not dismissing the fact her problems could be very real but the point of this is to discuss where the line should be drawn between taking behavior as being routed in various disorders and when the person simply being hard done by and being a obsessive narcissistic individual...

,depression,"Over the past 5 months my life seems to have fallen down a deep hole. I had a mental crisis and was hospitalized against my will, I’m 23 by the way, even though I wasn’t suicidal I just wanted a break from all of the responsibilities and expectations that everyone had of me. I quit my job and shortly after I woke up one day and couldn’t get out of bed. Long story short I have a herniated disc which has prevented me from working or doing normal things since then. I went through all the PT and pain management with no change and now the pain has spread from just my lower half to my upper back as well, I may have developed a second herniated disc and all the while I’ve been fighting with insurance to cover a surgery to fix it. On top of this I have a sinus infection that didn’t go away with extra strength antibiotics and actually got more painful after and I’m so fatigued I can barely function which is not good because I have a dog and he needs me. At the same time as all of this I have anxiety, depression and adhd and have my whole life but the adhd is newly diagnosed and I had to go off my anxiety medication to go on adhd medication and my psychiatrist is afraid of putting me on a new anxiety med with my surgery being so up in the air because he doesn’t want me to have to start and stop it because of the surgery. So my anxiety and depression is at an all time high (or low depending on how you look at it) and in the mean time I go to 2-4 different drs a week, I’m trying to keep up with grad school classes, I’ve been gaining weight and losing weight, got moon face from the steroids, deep purple stretch marks everywhere and one of my biggest depression triggers is my weight and feeling like I’m fat, which I am now which makes it worse, so I feel like a beached whale and no one will show me any ounce of support.

I had a mental crisis and was hospitalized against my will, I’m 23 by the way, even though I wasn’t suicidal I just wanted a break from all of the responsibilities and expectations that everyone had of me. I quit my job and shortly after I woke up one day and couldn’t get out of bed. Long story short I have a herniated disc which has prevented me from working or doing normal things since then. I went through all the PT and pain management with no change and now the pain has spread from just my lower half to my upper back as well, I may have developed a second herniated disc and all the while I’ve been fighting with insurance to cover a surgery to fix it. On top of this I have a sinus infection that didn’t go away with extra strength antibiotics and actually got more painful after and I’m so fatigued I can barely function which is not good because I have a dog and he needs me. At the same time as all of this I have anxiety, depression and adhd and have my whole life but the adhd is newly diagnosed and I had to go off my anxiety medication to go on adhd medication and my psychiatrist is afraid of putting me on a new anxiety med with my surgery being so up in the air because he doesn’t want me to have to start and stop it because of the surgery. So my anxiety and depression is at an all time high (or low depending on how you look at it) and in the mean time I go to 2-4 different drs a week, I’m trying to keep up with grad school classes, I’ve been gaining weight and losing weight, got moon face from the steroids, deep purple stretch marks everywhere and one of my biggest depression triggers is my weight and feeling like I’m fat, which I am now which makes it worse, so I feel like a beached whale and no one will show me any ounce of support. My friends are dealing with their own shit and my family is busy and any time I bring up how I’m struggling they just compare it to when they had back problems or how they have pain too even though none of them struggle with mental health.

I hate to justify myself but because of my past memories, I have gotten attached to the wrong people and been battling addiction since then. I actually feel like myself when I'm high or fucking random people I met on the internet. I know I shouldn't be doing this to myself but I keep relapsing every time. I let myself be groomed by several people over the period of 4 years, and was pretty much abused physically. My parents know this but they always blame everything on me.

Although my parents really care about me and will do anything for me, they just don't understand and keep trying to help me the ""asian"" way and it just makes me wanna kill myself even more. Literally everytime I relapse, all they do is take away everything I like, such as my computer or games and force me to be happy when it simply don't work like that. I have two security cameras in my room and although I get why they do this, they dont try to talk to me but rather punish me and give me the silent treatment.

&lt;p&gt;I hate to justify myself but because of my past memories, I have gotten attached to the wrong people and been battling addiction since then. I actually feel like myself when I&amp;#39;m high or fucking random people I met on the internet. I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing this to myself but I keep relapsing every time. I let myself be groomed by several people over the period of 4 years, and was pretty much abused physically. My parents know this but they always blame everything on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although my parents really care about me and will do anything for me, they just don&amp;#39;t understand and keep trying to help me the &amp;quot;asian&amp;quot; way and it just makes me wanna kill myself even more. Literally everytime I relapse, all they do is take away everything I like, such as my computer or games and force me to be happy when it simply don&amp;#39;t work like that. I have two security cameras in my room and although I get why they do this, they dont try to talk to me but rather punish me and give me the silent treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time, I told them they just told me that I&amp;#39;m trying to justify my current problems with trauma and that I&amp;#39;m selfish not caring about them. I also really want to go through therapy but that hasn&amp;#39;t been an option with them. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks to all who read this. Wish each and every one of you all the best. I’m posting here because I don’t know what else to do.

I’ve also been dealing with suicidal thoughts lately, and now I get a rush of thoughts centred along the lines not wanting to go on whenever it dawns on me that she’s not going to be coming over anymore or want to see me.  

I know relationships aren’t the be all and end all and I’m grateful for the good times we had, as well as the good things in my life, I really am. But I’m also so fucking sad.

,depression,"I’ve had depression for 5 years. I’ve fought through so much, I’ve gotten so far. Things are better in many ways, but the opposite is true for others.

Meds work for a while, until they don’t. Then I’m put on new meds, and they work for a while, until they don’t. It’s always the same. The symptoms disappear and then slowly reappear one by one by one. The process is slow enough to fool me into “sticking it out” in hopes that the dip is a mere dip and not a sinkhole. But, it always is a sinkhole. I go from functional and happy to bed bound and miserable in the span of a week. 

My psychiatrist put me on Prozac, my third medication) a month ago. The last medication, effexor, worked for a year and a half before it began to falter. When it did, we increased the dosage until I was fine again, all the way up to the max. Then it stopped entirely. So, given that track record, it made sense that when prozac began to falter we started the usual process of increasing the dosage in hopes of improvement, even if it’s only temporary. This time though, only my mood has improved. Everything else is worse. 

It’s a weird feeling to have all the usual symptoms of depression without the downer mood. No raincloud over my head, no frown on my face, yet still my soul is decaying, rotting in my chest. Existential dread chases me every waking moment and distractions just aren’t working anymore. I’m getting psychosomatic aches and pains to complement the emotional suffering too, chaining me to my bed and away from my usual coping strategies. 

When a medication works, it’s like I can finally see the light again. I bask in it. I etch it into my memory, so I can remember why I’m fighting so hard. I want that light to stay longer. I want the darkness to recede just enough so I can feel the light’s warmth again. I want to live more than ever before, but the pain and mental anguish of being alive is more than I think I can handle. 

Yes, there are still more treatment options to try. Yes, I just have to wait out the new doses, give the medication a chance. If it doesn’t work, there are mechanical/neurological therapies that can be done. I’m privileged enough to have access to all this health and support... but I’m tired of fighting. I’m tired of being brave. I’m tired of being strong. I just want peace. I just want to rest. I just don’t want to be alive anymore.

Despite all that though... I’m choosing to stay alive. Every day, that is my sole goal – to make it to the next day alive. Tonight has been awful and terrible and I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy, but I’m choosing life tonight even if my heart feels like someone put it in the blender on max speed with some nails and sharp glass to add crunch. I’ll stand in the pool of my own soulblood for as long as it takes, acidic properties be damned, until I can feel that light again. 

Fuck you, depression. You might have me cornered, but I’m not letting you win. I’ll die someday, but it won’t be by my own hand.

,depression,"Right now I genuinely feel demotivated!!! To shower... to get dressed up.. to do my hair and make up... to exercise to create music. I am forcing myself to write just in case I start briefly ""feeling better"" and become forgetful on my current state of being until it creeps back around and bite me in the ass!

I feel very down and out... Numb...disassociated... 
like dreading existence. I have most ""things"" I have always hoped and wished for ... I feel like I'm currently in this mood because of reality being in the state that it's in... or maybe it's just me?!?

what state you ask? 

Well ... EVERYTHING seems forced to name a few; 
working a job... dating... which feels like work... being creative which I used to have no effort doing ...don't know where that went! At one point I just didn't have the tools but now that I have the tools ...no effort 

why? 

I repeat this same one worded question daily... like a mantra! I let go of toxic associates... I think I am free from anxiety...

yet maybe not? 

...It's this feeling of uncertainty and it really burdens me! I want to be at peace and always on a high level of frequency even in the midst of milestones whether positive or negative. I genuinely don't believe a change in location can do that although lately it's been weighing on my mind! It may open up more levels to meet new people but 

...how would I know? I could be somewhere where people aren't too friendly plus with Covid it makes it worse and to top it off I am extremely introverted... 

do I like people? 
...HELL nahhh but, I try! 

I want to achieve... I literally fight for my life everyday!!! I stay up through the night training to cultivate my mind towards any endeavors in life itself! 

Well I guess the only way to unfeel is to zone out and live relentlessly?!?

Why else would I be held back from myself?!?

My mind is at war with my emotions ...my emotions create problems within my body... and my being/soul is just taking all of this terrorizing pain! Its insane really 

...I wish there was a way that I could start over?! I could be less doubtful of myself and more stern and discipline! I feel like I have no back bone...like I'm just a trapped soul hovering in a meat suit that I have no actual control over besides basic human functions even then I don't actually choose when to eat, shit or piss so not really lbvs

 ...It's as if I'm flowing throughout space and time letting external forces influence every choice I make. I see other souls who're either in their own state of ""heaven or hell""! 

I am aware that we are all an extension of the divine creator... I understand that there are roadblocks and that everything is temporary. I understand that I'm on borrowed time! I am just curious as to why I know all this information but feel as if I'm paralyzed within which causes my outer body to be at a standstill along with heightened emotions that are extremely toxic for my sanity! 

I want love but, I know human love has conditions no matter which body, soul and mind I choose to coexist with long term. My only cross to bear is actually doing it! Like the idea of everything is awesome and I can see that there are levels to unlock within this reality. What I can't seem to comprehend well is my own doings, thinking, discipline, patterns and behavior! This is not a pity party this is just my current state of mood. I would like to expand on this and get to the root of the trails and errors or better yet, grow rapidly within from the determination,confident and contentment aspects. Yet, it feels unbearable and meaningless.

I can literally sit and daydream for hours on end imagining living my life again, experiencing happier times and doing things differently as to not end up in the situation I'm in now, namely 25 years old with no higher education, no real career or life skills and with barely any of the kind of memories people in a similar situation would have in place of these things. I have ADD so this may compound the issue. 

I totally lose myself into these daydreams to an extent that some days I literally spend more time fantasising about this than actually living my day to day life. These fantasies are extremely vivid and feel very rewarding to lose myself in, and I catch myself hoping when I wake up the next day, I will be back to this time in my life. I am aware this is extremely unhealthy. 

I seen a comment I left 5 years ago on a music video on YouTube today and it's put me in a bit more of a funk than usual which led to me posting this. 20 year old me feels like a lifetime ago, I had totally forgotten about this, yet at the same time it seems I've blinked and 5 years have passed. I have next to nothing to show for these years gone by. All my passions, interests and outlets were sidelined due to my depression and absence of confidence, it reads almost like a black hole in my life history. And reading what I posted, it would appear I'm still the same depressed, lost soul I was at that age, and that is fucking morbid, lol.

The tiniest of things can set me off it seems, listening to 1979 by TSP the other day derailed all the momentum I had built in me that day to be productive, as the nature of the song brought forth my intense longing for the past and utter dread of the present and future. It feels like the past 8 or so years of my life have a been a dream due to the unrelenting nature of this thing. And I know idolising some romanticised view of youth/the past is foolish, but I can't seem to stop it.

I could've wrote this a bit more poetically but it's currently 4am where I live and I just wanted to get it off my chest and to see if others felt this way?

,depression,"I'm 3 months into almost full remission now. The remaining symptoms are reciding at a good rate, and I can think of looking for a job again, so I figured now is a good time to give you guys a summary of what I tried, and what worked and what didn't, or not fully.

I've been suffering from depression since 2015, with some partial and short lived remissions, but now is the first time I can say I'm not depressed anymore. It had major repercussions on pretty much every aspects of my life : aborted my career, end of a dozen years long relationship, financial and housing problems... My symptoms included anhedonia, sadness, general anxiety, social anxiety, lack of motivation and energy, cognitive impairment/brainfog, memory impairment, insomnia (worsen by some medications), self-loathing, pretty severe suicidal thoughts, substance abuse, reckless behaviors, irritability, all sorts of ruminations and depressive thoughts, some episodes of catatonia, and med-induced weight gains.

**WHAT HELPED THE MOST**

* **Ketamine :** Ketamine is not approved for psychiatry where I live. It's not impossible to get some legally, it's under trial at the moment, but it's a real pain in the ass and there are waiting lists, so I bought some on the black market and self-medicated. This might have been the single best decision in my life. It made my life go from hellish to bearable in a matter of weeks. It didn't cure me, but it's by far the greater improvement I've witnessed. I started a few weeks before an appointment with a new psychiatrist, in a fait accomplis line of thought, to be monitored and get access to ADs on top of it. It went well, no objection. I was taking it every few days at first, then every week. I took a two months break to reset tolerance after a few months, which worked.
* **California rocket fuel (sertraline + mirtazapine) :** The first combo of monoaminergic antidepressant I added to ketamine. It took some time to find the right dose of each molecule, but once we did it really did improve every symptoms. Only side effect was some errectile dysfunction and drop of libido, but nothing too bad. I discontinued because there is some suspicion of some form of bipolarity, and my psychiatrists thought this could put me at risk of mania. The withdrawal was pretty harsh compared to every other med I've dicontinued so far.
* **Tranylcypromine + mianserin :** The replacement. I started with tranylcypromine alone. It gave me insomnia so I was prescribed quetiapine with it, but it wasn't really optimal for sleep and made me gain a lot of weight, to a point a reached obesity for the first time of my life. I had to argue a bit due to the overcautiousness around MAOIs' interactions, but I managed to get mianserin instead. It worked a bit better for sleep, was less problematic regarding weight (but not perfect by far), and it significantly improved my mood. Tranylcypromine is also better for focus, cognition and so on than the other ADs I tried. The symptoms that remained after the introduction of mianserin were chaotic sleep hours, unstable energy level, and the weight.
* **rTMS :** It caused some sleep disturbances during the therapy but significantly improved every symptoms. I could stop ketamine after this.

**OTHER THINGS THAT REALLY HELPED**

* **Ashwagandha (whitania somnifera) :** The herb that finally managed to stabilize my sleep. I cannot say I have noticed any effect on weight, mood, cognition etc. on the other hand.
* **Zopiclone :** Not for long-term use, but as a punctual sleep aid it did come handy.on many occasions
* **Mirtazapine :** My first AD. My circadian cycle was completely obliterated at the time, and mirtazapine really helped with that, and tackled some of my depressive symptoms too for a short time, in monotherapy. It didn't last however. Except for tranylcypromine, I've had mirtazapine on top of every AD I had and it works wonder to both counteract AD-induced insomnia, and augment the antidepressant effect.
* **Alpha-GPC :** Really helps with brainfog, cognition, memory...
* **Huperzine A (from huperzia serrata) :** Same, but more energic, good for motivation
* **L-theanine :** Pretty good anxiolitic, and helps a bit with focus, especially when combined with coffee. Not too sedative.
* **Skullcap (scutellaria lateriflora) :** Also a pretty good anxiolitic with a pretty good anxiolisis/sedation ratio, and some slight stimulating property
* **Picamilon :** Not available in every country, but it's a very good short acting anxiolitic, also with some stimulation too, and that caries much less risks than the usual GABAergics. Helps a bit with focus too.
* **California poppy (eschscholzia californica) + valerian root (valeriana officinalis) + lemon balm (melissa officinalis) :** My go to herbal blend before I discovered ashwagandha. It's not perfect, but it's a mix of GABAergics that you can use long-term.
* **Journaling :** When you are really deep into depression, even writing a single sentence each day can be a challenge. But doing so helps in many ways. Writing your thoughts down helps free your mind of ruminations. It gives you some hindsight, and it makes suffering a bit less pointless : you're collecting data so future-you can use it to better fight depression, and better take care of bad days-you. It's also a good way to keep in mind all the progress you've made.
* **Behavioral activation :** Not really doable below some depth, but IMO the first thing to try if ADs alone aren't enough.
* **Cognitive restructuring :** The other big part of CBT. Helps with depressive thoughts. Doesn't suppress them, but helps taking some distance.
* **16:8 diet :** After the first few kg, I was stuck at the same weight for a time after stopping quetiapine. I started loosing wight again with this fasting diet. I stop eating at 14:00 until the next morning. I'm loosing 1kg every two days on average since. The first night was a bit difficult, but now I seem to sleep better that way too.

**HELPED A BIT**

* **Mindfulness :** Mainly enhanced the effect of cognitive restructuring. (not if you too down currently)
* **Fluoxetine :** Definitively improved my condition, but not quiet enough, and didn;t last. Insomnia (corrected with mirtazapine), erectile dysfunctions and reduced libido as side effects.
* **Venlafaxine :** Same
* **Lorazepam :** Really helped with sleep and anxiety, but tolerance and addiction comes fast. I had no trouble tapering though.
* **Alprazolam :** Same, so I only used on a short period
* **EPA+DHA (from alguae):** Noticeable effect on the mood, anxiety, irritability...
* **Creatine :** Helped with everything but sleep, and with weight too
* **Lion's mane :** Noticeabe effect on mood and cognition
* **&gt;1 hour of sun exposure per day :** helps with mood, anxiety and sleep
* **Exercising :** Good for mood, irritability, motivation and weight loss obviously. Take it really slow. Putting yourself through failures is the least thing you want.
* **Pregabaline :** Excelent for social anxiety, sleep, significantly lifts mood too, but addictive so I only used it punctually. Phenibut is somewhat similar but not as good, but it is OTC in several countries. Try picamilon instead if you can.
* **5-HTP (from griffonia simplicifolia) :** noticeable effect on mood and anxiety
* **ASMR :** Really helps with sleep and anxiety if you are sensible to it. Don't hesitate to try different chanels.
* **Cold showers :** energy, motivation, maybe weight loss too
* **CBD :** When L-theanine or skullcap isn't quiet enough, can add some extra anxiolisis, but nothing spectacular either, and not enough on its own.
* **Konjac :** helps manage hunger from meds
* **Beta-alanine :** Weight loss
* **Stopping tobacco :** Improved my sleep

**HELPED SOMEWHAT, OR NOT TOO SURE**

Cyamemazine (anxiety), alimemazine (sleep), magnesium L-threonate and glycinate (sleep), white noise (anxiety), SuperBetter app, vitamine D3, reading about Young schemas, ginkgo biloba (energy, focus), melatonin (sleep), chamomile (sleep), verbena (sleep), lavender (sleep), ALCAR, taurine, NAC, cannabis (sleep), gratitude journal, music (anxiety), coleus forskohlii (weight loss), CLA (from safflower, weight loss), metformin (weight loss, triggered an hypoglicemia the first time I tried it), green tea, risperidone (anxiety, cravings, irritability)

**DID NOT SEEM TO HELP**

Inositol, chromium picolinate, zinc, CoQ10, apple cider vinegar, meratrim (sphaeranthus indicus + garcinia mangostana), hydroxyzine, tiapride

**MADE IT WORSE**

* **Quetiapine :** Made me oversleep at first, then wasn't enough for a whole night, so I upped the dose, which made me oversleep again, until it wasn't enough again... Made me gain a lot of weight, which added one more problem to my mess of a life. Hated it.
* **7-keto-DHEA :** I've got weird reactions to this one : sometimes heat and elevated heartbeat, which seems to be worse with caffein, and sometimes fatigue, brainfog or bad mood.
* **GHB :** Helped a lot with social anxiety for a time, until I got hooked and had to go through withdrawal, and boy you don't want to go through that. As for sleep, it does make you sleep if you take enough, but it's a really weird and unnatural kind of sleep in my opinion, with a rebound in the middle of the night.
* **Alcohol :** In terms of sheer anxiolisis, I don't think anything can beat it. But it was just too deshinibiting for me, and I couldn't keep all my self-destructive tendencies in check with it. At some point I was more afraid of the shit I would do if I drank than it was helping me be more social, completely defeating the purpose.",t2_zvxpk,False,,0,False,"In remission after years of hell, here's what helped me and what didn't",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_m1x0pz,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,1615382117.0,,[],{},,True,,1615410278.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 3 months into almost full remission now.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quetiapine :&lt;/strong&gt; Made me oversleep at first, then wasn&amp;#39;t enough for a whole night, so I upped the dose, which made me oversleep again, until it wasn&amp;#39;t enough again... Made me gain a lot of weight, which added one more problem to my mess of a life. Hated it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7-keto-DHEA :&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ve got weird reactions to this one : sometimes heat and elevated heartbeat, which seems to be worse with caffein, and sometimes fatigue, brainfog or bad mood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GHB :&lt;/strong&gt; Helped a lot with social anxiety for a time, until I got hooked and had to go through withdrawal, and boy you don&amp;#39;t want to go through that. As for sleep, it does make you sleep if you take enough, but it&amp;#39;s a really weird and unnatural kind of sleep in my opinion, with a rebound in the middle of the night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol :&lt;/strong&gt; In terms of sheer anxiolisis, I don&amp;#39;t think anything can beat it. But it was just too deshinibiting for me, and I couldn&amp;#39;t keep all my self-destructive tendencies in check with it. At some point I was more afraid of the shit I would do if I drank than it was helping me be more social, completely defeating the purpose.&lt;/li&gt;

To give a bit of a context, I've been away from home for almost a year in another rented place to continue my studies, and there I have two cats, an awesome PC I've managed to build last year from parts, a job, independence and everything an adult technically requires to ""adult"".

The worst part is, this feeling is not linked only to this place; it seems to have invaded the rented place as well. I stay up at nights, and I keep wondering: is this it? I seem to no longer connect to anybody from here, I'm in no mood to talk most of the days, and all I want the majority of time is to sleep, and sometimes play games on my PC, but even that is losing its glamour. I have a Masters, which now I see it as futile, and it really is, as that diploma would not help me with anything at all in the future; I've started it since my ill father wished it. But I can't blame him, it was my choice.

The pros always outweighed the cons. But, lately, I feel like all I'm doing is compromise after compromise, I feel like we're no longer compatible on various areas of our lives, perhaps, due to the fact, that I'm in no mood to do anything these days. And it's understandable, she's young, and so am I; she wants to travel, have fun, and I... just want to sleep, and I'm always tired. I feel like I'm robbing her of her most fun and memorable years if she stays with me, and the guilt that comes from that just makes me get colder to her, leading to fights, arguments and hurt feelings.

Apparently I am good at detecting my irrational thoughts. I had multiple therapists acknowledging that about me, so not sure wtf that means now. Maybe I am not good enough at detecting all of them and I might still have some weird believes to dig out. How on earth do I pull myself out of this?  Maybe this shit is genetic. 

I am depressed since I know myself. 90% of my life is about being in low moods with some sparks of joy. One period I didn't really feel pain was during 3 years of a 4 years relationship where she was also depressed and I had a codependent role of taking care of her. That gave me purpose, in a way it felt I help myself. I felt she is my feminine reflection in this absurd and complex universe. Then she cheated on me and since then I think I didn't fully recover anymore. Insomnia also got pretty bad since then and got even worse 3-4 months ago when I got cheated on again by a partner who struggles with a personality disorder.

Strangely to me, I was very praised at work across time and very much appreciated. Also I was an outstanding student, and then valedictorian. But depression was always there. I guess I can be damn good at things when I set my attention on, but I do not derive pleasure out of anything anymore. Fuck praise, seems so superficial. I know I am not rotten.

I felt significantly less depressed, anxious and frustrated and more relaxed and even joyful. I know these things don't cure depression or anything, but they helped me. After a while I didn't even need to discipline myself to do them. I even looked forward to the things on my schedule and felt accomplished and calm at the and of the day. 

Anyway last week something stressful happened and since then it's been going downhill. No joy, no motivation, no drive, nothing.

Of course I know this by now. It comes and eventually it goes. But I just want it to be a little less devastating if somehow possible. So here is what I need advice on:

would you try to force yourself to stick to the schedule knowing that it helps my brain produce serotonin and dopamine and helps even if I don't feel it in the moment? Hoping that the episode is maybe less brutal or shorter than the last one. and hoping it will help me stay afloat and able to deal with the aftermath of this episode better. Also hoping that it helps me stay healthy in the long run (physically healthy).

Or would you try to sit it out and be compassionate and not force yourself to do the stuff you know is good for you, but is just so hard right now?

I just want a steady job that'll enable me to live in my own apartment in a city somewhere (not necessarily in my own country, I'm willing to relocate wherever I find a job). I hold a master's degree in history, and I know what my strengths and weaknesses are. I'm fairly good at writing and proofreading, but it's a very competitive field.

What I realised was I was looking for others to fill that void I had inside of me 
Whether that was relationships social encounters or whatever I would even play the clown look as though I’m as on top of the world but deep down I felt lonely as hell 🤡 

When in the end all I had to do was find myself love who I am and everything that made me who I am 🎶❤️

Only then was I able to start really loving myself and going for what I believed in what’s i dreamed of and not caring what others thought 💭 😊 💕 

Because when you love yourself you don’t need other people’s opinion or approval you just need to be yourself and as long as you’re being yourself and doing what makes you happy you can’t be lonely anymore. ☺️

,depression,"37. Lived in Philly for 6 years. I feel like all my coping mechanisms are just eroding. I just lost the person I was closest to in this world, my grandma, a month ago. She was in Florida. When I found out, I was throwing up from my second covid shot, as I work in healthcare. 

But even before my grandma passed, I wasn't doing well. And now her death is just showing me I need help. I've been having panic attacks every time I try to sleep. My heart just starts beating and I start sweating at times. All my repetitive feedback loops of terrible thought: ""Get ready to be homeless again."" ""Just give up."" ""Your co-workers hate you."" On and on. I do have a history of trauma and abuse. One year ago I left a very toxic relationship that was abusive. My already precarious mental health worsened during that four year relationship. Then you break up a week before Covid shutdown. Then you pick up shifts on your Covid unit because you can't be alone with yourself. Then maybe you drive to Brooklyn to meet some friends and have your first seizure, black out, crash through a wooden table, and paralyze your 4th nerve in your right eye, wearing an eye patch for 6 mos, while having no support from your parents. 

So what happens? The eye heals. The panic attacks and depression and insomnia does not. I pass the time by just working and focusing on not destroying myself. I read a lot of ridiculous books on Cryptids and begin crying at odd unexpected times. I also talk to my grandma in Florida often and mail her a mystery book from amazon once a month. 

Now she's gone. I feel blank. I know I need help. I'm burnt out. Have always had friends everywhere I've lived. But social circles shrink as you age and move to new places.

I've had depression, OCD, and anxiety for most of my life but these past two years (thanks to a horrific breakup and Covid) my depression has been the worst it's ever been.

I just moved into a new apartment and my roommates probably think I am insane because I have ordered food out everyday for a week straight. My disgust OCD ALWAYS acts up when I move into a new place, rendering me completely unable to cook for a little while until it subsides because I get disgusted by absolutely everything in a new apartment (don't know why, just know it's attributed to my OCD). One of my roommates actually asked me if I ever cook. Which is funny because when I was living with my family still, I cooked often and am known amongst the fam for my cooking skills. Not to mention, I have piles of clothing and junk that I just can't seem to muster up the courage to put away. They have asked me a few times how my room is coming along and I feel so ashamed because I keep making up excuses as to why I haven't finished it yet (mind you- I live in NYC in a VERY small apartment and my room is a shoebox and doesn't even have a closet). I am currently in between jobs and waiting to hear back from someone I just interviewed with, so I have no structure in my day which means I usually wake up everyday at 11:30 am. because sleeping feels better then waking up feeling miserable. Every day I wake up with the intention of starting fresh and making an effort, but inevitably, this poisonous fog of hopelessness fills my brain everyday around 3:00 p.m. and I don't get anything done. I am struggling immensely in school with the work load and have fallen behind in my classes. Last semester I was fortunate enough to have extremely understanding professors and I somehow managed to make straight A's, but i don't think i will get this fortunate again as my professors this semester are much, much harsher and stricter and I know I can't keep pulling the ""I'm struggling with my mental health"" card.

,depression,"I had been thinking about it for about 2 years and finally one day I set a date for 30 days from then. Gave myself 30 days to get my affairs in order and plan the whole thing. That whole time there was no fear or sadness. Just acceptance. 

The whole thing was in fact logical, ok years have passed in this depression and daily fatigue and I've tried everything from meds to religion and prayer to exercise, therapy, forcing myself to try new activities, eating and sleeping better and taking my vitamins, EVERYTHING. It took an insane amount of energy just to do any of these things. It takes an insane amount of energy just to get through a day of doing nothing. Ending it is more logical than having a life that is negative. 

So I set the date and the next month was peaceful. More peace and acceptance than I've felt in a long. The peace of knowing that A GOOD THING WAS COMING. 

I planned it out perfect. How did I fail? ... The only fear I had was that I was gonna chicken out and not go through with it. Well, I was sharpening a knife daily and would draw a line on my wrist with a marker. The perfect slice to cut the radial artery. I was amped. Wasn't afraid of the knife pain. 

On the night of, to fight the fear of chickening out I took some benzos to chill me out just in case I felt anxious or afraid. I sat in my tub with my knife. Started writing a letter...... And then I fell asleep. The benzos put me to fuckin sleep. 

I woke up in the morning with a half written letter hating myself for failing the perfect plan. No problem i would try again.

Why am I still here? Only Days later my father was diagnosed with termial cancer and I was the only one there to care for him. He lived for about a year after that and towards the end I was changing his diapers and doing everything. 

I still felt like shit everyday. Felt very weak and fatigued every day and still do. It's ironic that my dying father pretty much saved my life.

,depression,"Everything is going wrong. I'm barely keeping my grades up, I was demoted from pre-med to an undeclared degree, yet I've been too ashamed to tell anyone besides my mother, and she only knows because she's paying for my schooling (a privilege she may revoke if my grades worsen). I don't even want to go to med, school, but my true goals are unrealistic.

I have the most fragile sense of self, leading to unstable relationships, and the only reason I have any friends now is because I've known them for 4 years and they're used to by bipolar persona. I can't let anybody in, and I have the most amazing person interested in me for some reason, a friend, yet the idea of dating them disgusts me because I hate myself every single moment of my existence, and I don't want them to deal with someone as subhuman as myself. And the knowledge that they like me makes things 100x worse because it makes me mircro analyze every single aspect of myself to dictate if I'm good enough. This isn't the first time it happened, in the 9th grade, someone had a crush on me and it left me in a terrible depression where I cried about it, and drowned myself in sad music everyday because I hated myself so much, and now I had someone else and their friends paying attention to me and all the aspects I hated, seeing them look at me, made me ashamed to exist. I know this may not make sense to some people.

I hate the way I look and I cannot get myself to stop obsessing over it. I literally hate everything about myself from my face and hair to my hand and feet, to my shoulder and my friggin neck. Who the hell even obsesses over their neck? To make it worse, I had to get a surgery two years ago and I feel that it left part of me disfigured. Not enough to draw attention, but enough for me to hate myself even more. It's gotten to the point where I've removed the mirror in my room. Plus these masks make me feel like I'm catfishing everybody since I have people actually complimenting my body and upper face now and I've becoming debilitatingly anxious about removing it. The thought of disappointing everyone keeps me up at night even thought it's so stupid. Like, oh, you're not at attractive as I thought, oh well? Nah, it has me contemplating switching jobs.

I'm not particularly talented at anything. I'm actually pretty useless, I have a weird learning curve, and I don't make the most rational decisions because I'm not ""there"" half the time. I work an ok job, that has some really nice people, and some really terrible people that target me and gossip a lot. It's weird, because no matter where I go, people target me. It's like, I should be used to it, but I'm not, I guess people can just smell the insecurity. When my anxiety gets bad, I mess up in life and make a lot of mistakes. I get impulsive and make stupid decisions. I spend all my time on my phone, or half assing hobbies and dreaming about being talented in them and being recognized for that talent. I remember dreaming about getting so many awards at my hs graduation and now I laugh at myself because I'm doing the same thing about uni. I've spent so much money during quarantine, just to feel ok for 10 seconds, that I'm creating quite a hoard for myself and my credit score dropped quite a bit, the only thing to be ""proud"" of in context to my age. That's something else I should mention, I don't have a single thing in my life that I'm proud of. Not one in all my years of life.

I'm on the verge of crying 24/7 so the slightest thing could throw me off. That person I mentioned earlier didn't say hi to me in a very happy tone once, and I went and cried in the bathroom. I sculpted for the first time in a while and cried because it filled me with so much dread. I'm extremely mentally, not there. If I'm not wallowing in my own self pity, I'm hyperactive, or catatonic and withering away in my bed. I sleep like 16 hours a day on average now.

I also have a terrible personality. I avoid everyone because I know they all hate me. For this reason, none of my family actually likes me and constantly calls me derogatory terms, it's made even worse when compared to the foil that is my siblings who are bubbly, outgoing, friendly and getting 80s and 90s in school. People at work, look down at their phones when they pass me because I'm so awkward and quiet when they speak to me, they don't know if they should think of me as a stranger or an acquaintance, and it leads to mutual avoidance. I'm quick to shut down anyone being nice to me so they don't know what a terrible person I am.

I'm years behind on things I wanted to do as a teenager. In fact, I basically wasted most of my teenage years as a homebody and it seems as if I'll waste the next few decades as well.

Things just get worse and worse and I don't know when I'm finally going to snap. The only thing that keeps me going is the possibility that things COULD get better, my delusions, but I don't see any of that happening with how fargone I am. I've started compulsively scratching myself again which isn't something I've done since HS, and I'm scared it's going to elevate into worse things again. It's my birthday in a few months and I didn't do any of the things I said I was going to do this year, none of which should have been affected my quarantine. I haven't been happy since I was too stupid to realize that I'm a waste of life.

The only thing that keeps me going is the possibility that things COULD get better, my delusions, but I don&amp;#39;t see any of that happening with how fargone I am. I&amp;#39;ve started compulsively scratching myself again which isn&amp;#39;t something I&amp;#39;ve done since HS, and I&amp;#39;m scared it&amp;#39;s going to elevate into worse things again. It&amp;#39;s my birthday in a few months and I didn&amp;#39;t do any of the things I said I was going to do this year, none of which should have been affected my quarantine. I haven&amp;#39;t been happy since I was too stupid to realize that I&amp;#39;m a waste of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank-you for the hug! That was something I really needed right now :)&lt;/p&gt;

When I was a teenager, I had strong work ethic. I went to work as much as I could. I wanted to be productive. I would even so much as call my job at the time on my days off to see if they needed anyone extra as they were often short handed. That eventually completely changed. 

I’m now a 25 year old woman. Or I’m trying to be. 

The more jobs I got, the more I got comfortable calling off or being late. Most of the time, it was usually because I was so tired even after a full nights rest, that I wanted to just stay in bed. I have been fired from every single job I’ve ever had (except for my first one) because of this. And I’ve had pretty decent jobs. I was working one job that I really loved 2017-2018. I worked for a bank. I was actually doing really great and rarely called off unless it was absolutely an emergency. I thought my old habits had finally died. I eventually started experiencing burn out and started being late and absent a lot again. This was a job I was doing great with for a solid year before I started falling off. Then, I had a really traumatic breakup with my bf at the time, and I spiraled. Ever since I lost that job, (along with my car, and my apartment) I have been struggling ever since. This was the end of 2018. It is now 2021 and I am currently jobless. (I’ve had a handful of part time job in between then and now, which I’ve lost due to just simply never showing up again) I feel so low in life because I know I am better and smarter than this. 

I am now in a terrible living situation that is obviously hard to get out of with no money or car. (I have a car but I cannot drive it because my license was suspended due to insurance lapse from-you guessed it- not having money or a job). I am waiting on my tax return and stimulus checks to be able to drive again. I want to land a great job but I’m afraid of my work history in addition to my history of poor work ethic. I’m also just not even sure if I trust myself to do it right. I’m ashamed of it and I want to turn it around so badly. I’m almost positive it is due to depression just as much as I’m just used to being this way at this point. 

The depression you get from feeling unproductive so you just continue to be unproductive is a hellish cycle I do not wish on my worst enemy. I feel like I am trapped in the corners of my own mind and it’s terrifying. 

I’m dating a really great guy at the moment who is responsible and has really strong work ethic. Being with him is honestly that extra fire under my ass to get my life back together. He doesn’t even know the extent of my poor work history and I never want him to know. At least not now. I want to be better because I don’t want to blow this healthy relationship, which is the only thing keeping me sane right now, and mostly I just want to do better because I know that I am capable of it if I could just unlock that motivation.

They cursed, threatened and stole from me and those who didn't simply abandon me all together so i thought was alone for around 6 years before trying online communication thinking it would be different. I was very wrong, it's just the same and worse at times because at least in real life you can tell if someone is lying to you or just pretending. Every single person who've I've talked to has lied about caring about me and always put the blame on me despite it being me who was pouring my heart out to them and doing the best that i could for them.

You might be wondering why I'm typing this then, it's because I'm scared of no one knowing anything about me. My biggest fear is being forgotten and if i can't leave memories behind then I'll leave my reasoning, warnings and advice for those who are like me. My first warning would be is to never get close to anyone online no matter who they are. If you've never met them in real life then you cannot trust them and you mustn't because one day they will hurt you. Second, don't help anyone unless they've helped you first. Oftentimes I would end up being the one helping others despite me being the one who asked for help in the first place and even though I did my best to help I got nothing in return maybe even money not much $5 here and there for steam games and such to try and make someone happy and play with them but in the end I was the one who was hurt badly. My third piece of advice is a little controversial I guess you could say and it's to never join the furry fandom for community. If you were thinking about being a furry don't what's the biggest mistake I ever made not only do most people already hate them the community itself is a cesspool of toxicity in fact the most hateful people I met were furries who were in the community for five years plus and who had fursuits. I'm sure there are good people in this community but most are destructive, they may seem like that isn't true a lot of them will try and say ""well that's just a minority"" I can safely say in my case that isn't true it's honestly the majority. So if you're looking for a community to join I would avoid furries and look elsewhere for people with common interest. My last piece of advice is to never go online asking for help or advice. I know that most people who are depressed and dealing with tough situations often look anywhere for some kind of help or release and in most cases turn to online chats. But this is a serious mistake often times either people will outright tell you that your problems are irrelevant or people will pretend that they want to help you only to use your weaknesses against you in some way to either hurt you or manipulate you. I've never been properly helped and I've even gone to doctors in real life so in my opinion the best way to cope with hard situations is to try and ignore them the best you can and deal with them the best you can until they are resolved or no longer a problem.

,depression,"I'm turning 27 in weeks. It's been 10 years since I'm out of high school. I've accomplished lots of things; everything I've ever wanted I've tried and either succeeded or failed, with no fear of failure.

And realizing this. Depression will never get better, only worse. Plus other diagnoses which all revolve around depression and wanting to be dead. That's a harsh realization into your head. You've been doing therapy and taking meds for more than half your life, and things have only gotten worse. You're a frequent hospital visitor. And it's not like you're a failure, you got your conquers here and there. But it won't get better. It's in your brain. It's not that something trigges you. The simple fact of being alive and feeling infinite doom and despair is what consumes you 24/7 even if you're doing good at work, lifting hard or succeeding in your hobbies.

I honestly don't know if I'll make it past 27. I don't want to. Life won't give me children, a wife, family of my own, or any family at all.

I&amp;#39;ve accomplished lots of things; everything I&amp;#39;ve ever wanted I&amp;#39;ve tried and either succeeded or failed, with no fear of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And realizing this. Depression will never get better, only worse. Plus other diagnoses which all revolve around depression and wanting to be dead. That&amp;#39;s a harsh realization into your head. You&amp;#39;ve been doing therapy and taking meds for more than half your life, and things have only gotten worse. You&amp;#39;re a frequent hospital visitor. And it&amp;#39;s not like you&amp;#39;re a failure, you got your conquers here and there. But it won&amp;#39;t get better. It&amp;#39;s in your brain.

,depression,"Hello,
First of all English is not my first language so sorry for the mistakes.

I'm a woman, I am 27 years old and I am a teacher. I have a difficult relationship with my mother and recently I developped an eating disorder.
 I have been struggling with depression and anxiety since the age of 15. I have attempted suicide and I have been sent to psychiatric emergencies when I was 20.
I have a fought a lot to get better but it is so pointless and I am tired. Therapy and my treatment don't work.

Everytime I try to get better I end up failing miserably.


I have next to zero self confidence and I don't have much social skills. I can be pretty shy/introverted and say stupid things.
I never dated anyone. I have been rejected every time.
So I can forget the whole ""loving a man and this man loving me back"" thing.
Because apparently I have a thing for hurting myself, I tried tinder without putting my photos. I got more matches than when I put my photo. Then gets the moment when I describe myself. It ends up with ""I am not attracted to Black women"". That's cool, that's your preference and no man owes me affection.
 However, for once in my life I wish I wasn't rejected. 
So what about Black guys? Well they are not interested in me either. Some of them also refuse to date Black women.

Anyway, at least I know will never have a chance when it comes to relationships. 

Overall, I feel I am too weak for this world. I have no strength left.

I felt betrayed. Every day I would hear people whispering about outside the room. I feel exposed. It's like they can see through me. I told my mom to pick me up from my grandmother's, she said she have some important things to do.

After I attempted I realised that it is not worth giving up and that there is so much more in life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get help but since I&amp;#39;m a teenager and don&amp;#39;t have a job I decided to tell it to my mother. My mom is someone I couldn&amp;#39;t trust but still I need professional help. At first I thought she would get angry and hurt me like she did before. To my surprise she responded calmly and told me that we&amp;#39;re gonna get help. I was so relieved to hear that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I was surprised that my grandparents fetch us from our house to their house. Later on I found out that my mom told my grandmother about my depression. Later on almost all my family learned about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt betrayed. Every day I would hear people whispering about outside the room. I feel exposed. It&amp;#39;s like they can see through me. I told my mom to pick me up from my grandmother&amp;#39;s, she said she have some important things to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate myself even more. I feel trapped and my suicidal thoughts got much worse. I&amp;#39;ve been &amp;#39;depressed&amp;#39; for a long time and I regretted opening up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, I don&amp;#39;t want to trust anyone again.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"My life is generally pretty privileged and I acknowledge and am grateful for the opportunities I've had, but I feel like I screw everything up with my depressive episodes and my anxiety.   


I never really had a solid example of a properly-functioning adult and it's become clear to me overtime that I had no idea how to properly function myself. Now that I have some idea I'm not sure I can do it consistently. Then the people closest to me think I'm lazy, un-ambitious and sloppy, but that's not who I am the other half of the time when I feel more myself and I am secure in who I am.   


I have periods where I feel happy or content, I eat well, spend time with people and do things that I love or that are self-improvement, but I'm like always waiting for the needle to drop. When it does, I have no concept of time, no energy or motivation and I can't find meaning or value in anything including myself. In a lot of ways I feel robbed of being my full self and I'm just tired of this stupid pattern that I just can't seem to break.   


I know I'm not lazy because I have been working since I was 15 and for many years have worked 2 jobs while going to school. I always make time for friends and family and have a decent social life, but I just can't seem to sustain it. It's become especially painful since going through a breakup with someone I loved very much. He decided I wasn't ""competitive"" enough for him and I think he means to say I am not ambitious enough. For many reasons, I am glad I am no longer in that relationship, but I just ache at the thought of my depressive episodes preventing someone from loving me. I have so much to offer otherwise I just can't seem to function consistently.   


I feel so restless. I want to move, but I'm afraid of being away from family and having an episode and not having a support system. I am in therapy and I want to pursue medication. I just feel so exhausted and broken and this doesn't feel like who I am supposed to be.

Eat healthier and watch funny movies. Hell I dont need to pay you to tell me what I've been told for years. When I told her my problems she seemed to just go ""hmmm yeah I see you're struggiling"" before I left her office I had a panic attack and she did nothing. Pills didnt work.

,depression,I’ve been depressed for awhile maybe because of doing acid every few months but I don’t know. I’m just not happy. My mind feels like it’s in a knot and I do the same thing everyday. I recently started smoking weed again and now I can’t stop. I just do school and play video games. All of my friends talk shit about me and everyone I ever have been close to has back stabbed me. I try to talk to people about my problems but they assume that since I live in a 2 story house that my problems don’t matter. Maybe they don’t though.

,depression,"TL;DR on bottom. 

I'm not suicidal. I've never wanted to die; in fact, I actually fear death. 

I'm just so tired of the things I'm expected to do to maintain a place in society. Go to school, get a job, find a partner (but don't let your mental health fall too much or else they'll leave you!) and then have kids and have them become your whole identity for the first few years. I used to be excited to go to college, to major in biochemistry and learn all there is to learn (since I love science). But now it just feels like a chore. The thought of failing out of college terrifies me, especially since I'll constantly have to be ""on guard"" in order to not fail (constantly paying attention, turning assignments in on time, etc.). 

I just hate the idea of living my whole life in a society of other people, where I'm constantly subject to others' perceptions of me, judgements, and expectations. It sounds so exhausting. I already do what I can to get out of it. I don't wear any makeup, I don't style my hair, I don't post photos on social media. Because if I did these things, I know I'd be exhausted 24/7, thoughts of other people consuming me. I'd get obsessed with trying to maintain whatever image I put out there, and then I'd feel distressed whenever I don't have the energy to do it, and eventually I'd give up and feel like shit. 

I'd rather just live my simple life. I even avoid shopping for clothes, since I'm perfectly content wearing the same clothes I have been for years. For some reason, I also never feel any need to explore new things. I listen to the same few songs every day and watch the same shows/movies constantly. I feel so behind everyone else because they're all constantly gaining new interests and I'm just.. in the same place. Don't get me wrong, I think I'm happy in this place, but it sucks feeling behind everyone else. 

This feeling of ""behindness"" just makes me feel shitty and stressed, so I never even try to explore new things because I know I'll never catch up to anyone else. Whenever I try to watch a show a friend recommended, I just feel so anxious because I know they're already ahead of me, that I either give up or take months to watch 12 episodes. 

The thing is, I actually *enjoy* doing things I like. The only new things I explore are when I go down a rabbit hole on Wikipedia, researching some era in history or science, since I love those subjects. I enjoy doing things I have to do *for myself,* like preparing food, working out, enjoying walks in nature. It's just that others' expectations exhaust me so much. 

**TL;DR:**

**I am tired because in life, you're constantly expected to be ""on guard."" I can't take take any breaks because there will always be more expectations and more things to keep up with, whether it's friendships, academics, hobbies, jobs. There's always something. You're permitted to take a break for a few days or even weeks if you're on vacation, but your default life is always intertwined with the rest of society. Your default life is one where you participate in society and create an identity for yourself to distinguish yourself from other people. Everything revolves around other people, and yet it's rare to find someone who will be your life partner forever, through all your flaws and mental health episodes.** 

In my ideal life, I'd be living safely in a cottage in the woods, enjoying things at my own pace, enjoying nature, and making food for myself. I'd be free. Are there any options for people who prefer this? Is this even legal?

&lt;p&gt;I just hate the idea of living my whole life in a society of other people, where I&amp;#39;m constantly subject to others&amp;#39; perceptions of me, judgements, and expectations. It sounds so exhausting. I already do what I can to get out of it. I don&amp;#39;t wear any makeup, I don&amp;#39;t style my hair, I don&amp;#39;t post photos on social media. Because if I did these things, I know I&amp;#39;d be exhausted 24/7, thoughts of other people consuming me. I&amp;#39;d get obsessed with trying to maintain whatever image I put out there, and then I&amp;#39;d feel distressed whenever I don&amp;#39;t have the energy to do it, and eventually I&amp;#39;d give up and feel like shit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d rather just live my simple life. I even avoid shopping for clothes, since I&amp;#39;m perfectly content wearing the same clothes I have been for years. For some reason, I also never feel any need to explore new things. I listen to the same few songs every day and watch the same shows/movies constantly. I feel so behind everyone else because they&amp;#39;re all constantly gaining new interests and I&amp;#39;m just.. in the same place. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I think I&amp;#39;m happy in this place, but it sucks feeling behind everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feeling of &amp;quot;behindness&amp;quot; just makes me feel shitty and stressed, so I never even try to explore new things because I know I&amp;#39;ll never catch up to anyone else. Whenever I try to watch a show a friend recommended, I just feel so anxious because I know they&amp;#39;re already ahead of me, that I either give up or take months to watch 12 episodes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I actually &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; doing things I like. The only new things I explore are when I go down a rabbit hole on Wikipedia, researching some era in history or science, since I love those subjects. I enjoy doing things I have to do &lt;em&gt;for myself,&lt;/em&gt; like preparing food, working out, enjoying walks in nature. It&amp;#39;s just that others&amp;#39; expectations exhaust me so much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am tired because in life, you&amp;#39;re constantly expected to be &amp;quot;on guard.&amp;quot; I can&amp;#39;t take take any breaks because there will always be more expectations and more things to keep up with, whether it&amp;#39;s friendships, academics, hobbies, jobs. There&amp;#39;s always something. You&amp;#39;re permitted to take a break for a few days or even weeks if you&amp;#39;re on vacation, but your default life is always intertwined with the rest of society. Your default life is one where you participate in society and create an identity for yourself to distinguish yourself from other people. Everything revolves around other people, and yet it&amp;#39;s rare to find someone who will be your life partner forever, through all your flaws and mental health episodes.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my ideal life, I&amp;#39;d be living safely in a cottage in the woods, enjoying things at my own pace, enjoying nature, and making food for myself. I&amp;#39;d be free. Are there any options for people who prefer this? Is this even legal? Is this a phase I&amp;#39;ll grow out of?&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I've written almost my whole life story here in short.. it might be little long and boring.. but please read it completely..


I'm 23yo (M) from india... I will be graduating this year..(I'm 2-3 years older that my batchmates as I've taken a gap of 2 year's after my highschool as I've taken 1 year of coaching for an exam which I'm not actually interested in.. which I realised later.. and the next year it was too late to get in to the university which I decided to join and that way that year was wasted aswell). I've chosen to study business administration.. so that I would be able to do anything instead of sticking to one specialisation..
 
And I'm just a very avarage student at academics aswell, I did nothing in terms of extra curricular activities or sports or anything since my childhood ( in my childhood I felt awkward and embarrassed upon failing on my first attempt of doing anything.. whether it be sports, dance or any extra curricular activities..so I've never stepped into any of those and I know nothing.. and now i regret it) I have no certificates or medals till now. And being an introvert and our family has been struggling financially since the past 10 years.. I don't have any friends whom I can call true friends.. though I wanted to go out with my friends I have been avoiding going out as I can't even afford food or fuel and don't want my friends to spend money for me all the time.. and i haven't visited any of my relatives or attended any family events/get-together's from the past few years.. and I rarely go out.. or talk to anyone.. and talking with girls.. forget about it.. since my childhood I've never had a friend who is girl and I never used to talk to anyone... I wish I had a sister.. atleast that way I would feel less anxious while talking to girls..


And since my childhood I've never really fell in love with anyone or I didn't even have a crush on anyone.. but in my second year of graduation I've been crushing on a girl so much.. and my feelings for her are genuine and pure. though she is my classmate I've never really talked to her  and as I've just started kind of flirting with her just by eye contact and have been sitting near to her in the classroom.. but then all of a sudden lockdown has begun and I've been staying at home all the day attending online classes.. but my feelings for her never faded.. we follow each other on Instagram, I know her phone number but I never dared to confess my feelings.. because I myself feel very inferior to her and her friends who are 2-3 years younger than me and have been doing good in their lives.. and on the other hand me who has achieved nothing in my live with.. no social life.. no friends.. have no idea about future. 
(You might be saying.. that I shouldn't compare myself with others and that I don't know what they are going through in their life.. they have problems to... etc..etc.. I understand that but I'm pretty sure atleast they are living Happily to some extent and no-one would be having all the problems at time like I have..)
And especially when I look at celebrities of my age or younger than me like.. Billie Eilish, Jung kook, Millie Bobby brown and many others who have achieved a lot in their lives I feel even more inferior..
And thinking about all this I've cried many times.. and I'm just Surviving my life and not really living my life.
And I will be graduating in 2 months and I've no Idea what to do next... While many of my friends are persuing higher education which I can't afford.. my only option is to do job.. but considering my resume and my social anxiety I'm not at all confident that I would get a good job.
It's not like I'm dumb at everything..  (I have intrest in and good at computer skills, I know little coding, I can cook, I can do good research on any give topic and I have knowledge on various topics that many wouldn't have.. and many other things) but the problem is I'm not good enough to make career out of it.. and I'm struggling to find out which one of them should I stick to and develop my skills in it and make a career out of it..
( I know that most of the problems in my life are because of my decisions that I took in my past, but whatever happened has happened. And I wanna get out of it but all the problems at once and one overlapping the other is scaring me and I'm not finding a way out..)

,depression,"So I’ve missed a lot of days of class because of major depression. Like I’ve been on the edge of suicide for weeks. Then, I missed two days of class because I had Covid-like symptoms. Then, my car wouldn’t start today when I tried to go to class. I emailed my professor and asked if I could get some makeup work for that day since my car wasn’t starting. He emailed me back and told me that he couldn’t give me any makeup work, that I needed to be in class, and that my getting makeup work wasn’t fair to other students. This is the first time I’ve asked for makeup work for missing class besides when I was quarantined, the other times I’ve just taken the L. I’m just frustrated and very upset.

I emailed my professor and asked if I could get some makeup work for that day since my car wasn’t starting. He emailed me back and told me that he couldn’t give me any makeup work, that I needed to be in class, and that my getting makeup work wasn’t fair to other students. This is the first time I’ve asked for makeup work for missing class besides when I was quarantined, the other times I’ve just taken the L. I’m just frustrated and very upset.

,depression,"Hey.

Don't allow anyone to push this ideology on you, and even further, watch out for falling into the trap of repeating this to yourself. Living with depression is already hard enough by itself, but being bombarded by this spiky sentence whenever you just can't really get yourself to start the day, takes it to a whole new level. 

~No. It's not that easy and please allow me to go a bit into the details of why.

The problem with this statement is not that it is harmful on it's own; but rather what these few words can trigger within, especially within a person who already has a low self esteem.
If you ever catch someone telling this to you, remember that they cannot even come close to seeing life from your point of view, based on your experiences in life and no one elses. NOBODY, but you know all the struggle you must deal with daily, in order to get as far as you are. All the hardship that came your way, you're still here and trying your best, even if that doesn't look like much now; it won't always stay like this.

Maybe these words mean nothing to you, other than a bunch of titanium white pixels on a black background (or any other color your might have lol), but it does get better by time; Sometimes by finding a higher purpose, or meeting a very special person, maybe getting a ""yes"" to that career choice you'd actually like to pursue but was afraid of talking about to your friends, or by seeing someone smile genuinely at you.

,depression,"So, I’m just gonna rant about my life right now for a minute, I just need to get what I’m feeling out there. I used to work at Wendy’s, for some time actually. I started July of 2020, and just recently quit a couple of days ago due to an issue I had with another coworker. The whole reason I had started working there in the first place was so I could be with my best friend at the time, Bella. We were really close, but didn’t get to see eachother because school was cancelled, so I decided to work there. Things went great for awhile. I got along with everyone, there was little to no drama, and work was overall a fun setting. In January of this year, Bella and I were transferred to a different wendys store because the store we were currently working at became permanently closed. I had a few friends that I worked with at my old location, but they were transferred to different stores, so I never saw them again. Once we were transferred, that’s when the drama started. It was right after Christmas, and I was feeling generous, also I felt bad for her because of her situation with her homophobic mother, also, I really loved her like a sister. I had given her a bag full of goodies that I had gotten her: a zodiac candle, pair of weed socks, shorts, a goddess keychain, a lighter and an entire joint. Since she’d never smoked real bud before, I thought I’d be nice and give her one so she could try it. Funny thing is, a week later, we never spoke again. There was another girl working there, let’s say her name is Vanessa. Bella had feelings for Vanessa, and had told me about her, but very vaguely. She did not mention Vanessa’s name or anything. Just that she had met this girl who she really liked. I had met Vanessa shortly after, and soon I had feeling for her as well. Only thing is Vanessa definitely seemed into me. I had told Bella that I met Vanessa and I really liked her and that I thought she was cute, etc. and Bella did not respond the way I intended. She said, verbatim, “nah I am not doing this today”. I was confused, so she then told me that Vanessa was the girl she was telling me about. The convo immediately got awkward, and I said that maybe I should back off, since Bella had met her first. She said “yeah” and that was all. We didn’t speak after that. This broke my heart because I felt like i shouldn’t have said anything, and that the relationship ending was my fault. Soon, I realized that why would I respect someone’s wishes if they aren’t even going to be my friend. Why am I going to sit here and miss out on a potential relationship. So that’s what I did, I started to pursue Vanessa, but not very well. I’m new to my sexuality, and I’ve never been with a girl before. At first, Vanessa was flirty, and definitely seemed like she liked me. (I’m 16 and Vanessa is 19). Then, we hang out one time, and the next day I ask her how she feels about me. She states she likes me, but I’m just too young. I then become pretty distraught and confused, because she had given me the impression not too long ago that I wasn’t too young, and that she had an interest in me. I broke down, I was pretty upset because I feared I was going to lose another person, and that all that was done was for nothing. I’m not sure what happened to cause her to do this. But Vanessa started leaving me on opened... a lot. This made me feel worse about myself. I had decided to be up front with her about how I was feeling. A guesstimate of what my words were: “so are you ghosting me or what, because I did not lose my best friend for a person that’s just going to ditch me. At this point, I really just would like a friend, because I really have no one right now”. She proceeds to open my snap, but instead of replying, she just flat out unadded me. Ghosted me on the spot. This really hurt, but at this point, I had lost feeling because of how often she was leaving me on read. Back to my job, I had quit a few days ago because this girl who I work with was being impossible to work with. It’s not the first time either. I was up front, so it’s my job to take peoples orders and bag everything, and then Hand it out. She was assigned on fries that day, so it was her job to hand out fries for drive thru AND up front orders. She already isn’t getting me what I need, so I ask her for a medium fry. She then says “no” and straight up walks away. At this point, I’m mad, and you can clearly see it. She continued to not get me any fries or chicken nuggets, which made me even more mad. I had to get everything myself, and what made it even more frustrating was she never fucking moved. I would have to wait for her to move so I could get the customers food. I’m very angry at this point, so when I go to get an order of nuggets, I tossed the tongs and they landed on the floor. She then asks me what my problem is and calls me a bitch. I don’t answer, she continues to not get me anything. I tried asking her again for what I needed, but I was ignored and treated as if I wasn’t even there. She leaves, I get what I need, but this time, she comes back and says “you can get everything yourself now since you wanna steal my shit” I’m like wtf are you talking about. I literally made it my fucking self. She’s yelling at me like I’m the problem, and then threatens to “take it outside” like bitch I’m not about to fight you over some goddamn fries. I’m very fucking angry and at this point I’m screaming at her while there’s at least 5 people in the dining area. I don’t care at this point. We’re yelling, and I told my manager I was quitting bc I can’t take it anymore. Mind you, stuff like this happens almost every time I come into work. Her and her bitch friends are all the same. Don’t give a fuck about anything. When they hear me say I’m quitting, they (I kid you not) high five each other and started laughing like they were happy I was leaving. I’m majorly distraught and really ready to beat someone’s ass at this point, so I just left. And I’m never going back. Now, My self esteem is extremely low, I have no friends left and I am extremely depressed. Not only that, I’m out of a job. I’m still in high school, so I also have that weight on me rn. I’m honestly too sad to care about school, like I just sit through my classes and never do any of the work. I just have no motivation. Weed is my only motivation because it’s the only thing that takes me away from the endless pain of being sober. I feel like My entire life is set in stone, and that I’m never going to be able to do what normal people my age get to do.  I’m never gonna get to go to a high school party, never gonna get to go clubbing, never gonna get to see a concert. Especially corona, no one can do anything anymore. Which doesn’t help my suicidal thoughts at all. The only person I have left is my mother, and I don’t even think she wants to spend time with me. She really knows how to wear down my self esteem without realizing it. Every day i am becoming more and more socially awkward. Just the thought of meeting someone new scares me. I’m afraid that I’m going to mess it up, like I always do. But yeah, I lost all of my friends, and now I’m stuck in this limbo that I’m scared is gonna be forever. And I’m so irritable. But instead Of my mom understanding my pain, she just punishes me and makes me feel bad for feeling this way. Like I really just want to die. I don’t want to live.

I was asking myself this question, and I'd love to hear your opinion about it.

Personally, I believe that sadness comes from unfulfilled desires. 
We live in a world where we tend to think that ""I can do it if I want to"". 
But that's a false statement, isn't it?
If we want to be someone that we're not, we will just suffer.
The same goes for relationships : not everyone is made to be with someone or to be loved.

I tried cigarettes for the first time in the seventh grade. Hash brownies in the eighth. My first drink in my freshman year of highschool and by the tenth grade I started smoking up. By the eleventh grade I began to smoke hash or hashish pretty regularly.  
I live in a city where most teenagers do these things and even my own best friends used to.  
But now out of that girl's group almost none of them do it and even I know I probably initiate it or do it the most. They all stop me and I do try to stop but I also can't help but forget about consequences and get carried away in the moment.  
My parents and siblings have found out several times and each time I cry and apologise. Everytime they end up trying to trust me again and I end up doing it again. Sometimes I try to genuinely stop and sometimes just trying to get them off my back. I used to do exceptionally well in school and everyone just assumed I'd make it big in life.  
They found out again yesterday after I came home drunk and high. I don't think they realised I was drunk but got me drug tested and it was positive. My father hasn't spoken to me since. My mother says I lack self control and discipline in all places in life and I know she's not wrong. I'm the youngest sibling. My sister who is nearly three years older than me has not spoken to me since either. My eldest sister and her child are due to visit at the end of the month and haven't made contact along with my brother who is already living in the US. My parents think if I move I will make my brother and three year older sister's lives miserable and stressed. They're not wrong. They think I'm going there for all the wrong reasons. I didn't think I was, I thought I'd suddenly clean up my act and get serious there because thats the vibe and atmosphere that my brother has created there.

I sit outside at night, watching the clouds roll by wondering why I can't just roll by into whatever existence they are rushing toward.   
My two dogs where the foundation of life as I came to know it.  Some people will relate, others won't.  It's a messy past,, so I won't try to explain it.  They both passed away within about a month of each other at about 11 years old, leaving me spiraling downward at an extremely alarming pace.

They talk to me a lot a lot I only ever see them out of the corner of my eye. When I’m high I see them well enough for a shadow. I understand I’m slowly losing my mind but have nobody to tell. My dad really wouldn’t do anything and my mom constantly pushes it off. I did tell her. These things give me a short temper. I have outburst sometimes and I’m constantly pissing off my family. they hate me they truly do. I’m the black sheep and they recognize it. I’m always starting a fight with someone subconsciously. I fuck up my life on purpose without wanting to. I feel like there all turned on me. I feel like a shell of a human projecting who he wants to be. I’m extremely lazy. It feels the more I want to accomplish a goal the further I get. I do this to myself without control. Maybe I feel like I don’t deserve the feeling of accomplishment. haven’t been stable for over 5 years. I almost was able to lie to myself for over a year until a fight sparked this side of me. I’ve tried to kill myself by od but I puked it up. I’m by myself over 90% of the time. I’ve gotten too good at being alone. The only time I’m truly happy is when I’m high. There is no other happiness in my life. I could kill myself very easily. I’m just to much of a pussy to pull the trigger. I’ve been sober for about a year but I’m going to relapse.
 Thanks all for reading my story. Not all stories end well&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hello, I am here to ask if anyone knows what I am talking about and to help me understand if I am depressed or just stressed.

I don't know the right way to describe it, but the feeling is like I have much less energy than I had before.I still enjoy some things, like watching tv shows or playing games or talking to family. I sometimes enjoy working on my business and developing software.

But most of the time I don't want to do anything and I don't have the same power I had before to motivate myself for something. Learning new things, finding interesting activities, I wish i did something like that, but at the same time **even the thought** of trying to do so seems too burdensome.

I am feeling that I don't improve anymore. And even though I am working on a lot of projects and I still have clients, my own business, new projects and loving family, at the same time I feel like I am stuck in one place and I am not moving in any direction.

Focusing on work is hard, relaxing is hard (because I am blaming myself for not improving and doing time-butning activities like scrolling  reddit).

Now I am starting to have sleep problems again (hypnogogia) and I also  started eating less.

But at the same time for a lot of time I feel.. okay. Not great, nut not bad too. It's just that sometimes I think about it and then it weighs on me so much that I feel really stressed about this situation.I am already visiting the psychoanalyst for a year now, but it doesn't seem to help with my feelings, it just helps me with understanding my situation and why I feel this way.

But even the thought of trying to fix this gives me much more stress than the stress alone.I just want to feel better and to do something ""alive"", without being stuck in a loop of the same projects and freetime activities.

But I don't have the power and motivations to ""force"" me to do something productive and helpful.

I am an introvert and need alone time but don't feel like I can get it. 

My apartment is very small so it's hard to get away from my cat, dog, and husband. I love all of them of course, but lately I have been feeling down and my husband can't understand what I'm personally going through. 
Most recently, I started taking lexapro. I started at 10 for a week and now I have been on 20 for two weeks.

After a weekend of not taking the adderall I felt sluggish so I took it Monday morning and felt really productive that day.

I was having a hard time articulating my answers to the interviewers questions whereas if I had interviewed a day before I would have been energetic and easily be able to answer accordingly. 

I am just tired of the side effects of my meds. I come off the ones that don't work then get on other ones, then it takes a while for those to work and the side effects are sometimes unpredictable, like during my interview. It's frustrating and I feel so helpless. 

I just feel like my life is shit now. I have been trying to stay positive. Exercising. But my mental fatigue won't let up some days. I just feel confused, alone, and like I cant talk to anyone. 

I need a job and some financial stability for myself but whenever an interview comes I end up seeming okay until I suddenly can't articulate what I had practiced. People notice I'm nervous.

,depression,"I'm writing this because I feel totally alone and I feel like such a loser.  I haven't had sex in like 6 months and I have serious trouble with intimacy.  When I was a teenager I had crippling social anxiety. I'd found that even in routine social interactions sometimes my hands would be shaking.  Naturally I had serious troubles when it came to girls. I was terrified to approach them.  People told me that I was cute and I even had a stalker, but when a girl showed interest in me or asked me out I thought it was part of an elaborate plan to play a joke on me.  I did well in high school.  I was a great student and athletic but I was so alone.  On the weekends I just stole booze from my parents and withdrew into a haze in my room.  I went to a prestigious college, but my social anxiety got even worse.  I began to think I was so ugly that I was deformed.  I would get very high and just stare at myself in the mirror.  It got so bad that it was hard for me to leave my room even for meals because I thought everyone was going to be staring at me and laughing.  Of course I was a virgin.  I would always tell myself that I was such a fucking loser and that no one would ever want me. I had opportunities to have sex but for some reason always turned it down.  I know it sounds like some loser saying that the only reason he doesn't have sex is because he doesn't want to.  I didn't even know why I turned it down.  I was really drunk and high stumbling around at a party and suddenly somebody was on my face and there was a tongue in my mouth. I was uncomfortable but also exhilarated.  It was a girl and I didn't even see her face beforehand. When I did, I didn't want to be with her anymore. I just felt so weird afterward.

I began to realize that I really needed an emotional connection. I became content to be a virgin until I could find somebody I really loved.  I'm not religious, I just felt so vulnerable or just off.  It's hard to describe.  I dated this girl one time who was my friend beforehand.  We were studying abroad in Germany.  Being in a foreign country was very isolating and she was the only one I really knew.  We spent a lot of time together.  She came to my room one time with a bottle of vodka to hang out.  She knew I had a drinking problem.  We watched a movie and I got very drunk.  I was slumped down and I tried to get up. She grabbed me and started making out with me. Then she pushed me onto the bed.  I didn't want to have sex and felt weird about everything.  She started crying because she knew I was depressed and worried that I was going to kill myself.  I didn't even say I was.  Ultimately I didn't want to date her. She would do things like come to my room with a big knife and cut herself in front of me or get really drunk in class so I would have to help her walk.  She said I was a ""scaredy cat"" because I didn't want to date her.  I felt so guilty.

I transferred colleges.  I don't think it was because of her.  I was even more alone halfway across the country from everyone I ever knew.  My mental health really began to decline.  I had always used substances as a coping strategy.  I had my first drink when I was 15.  That night the summer air was like a warm, loving embrace. More importantly I felt numb. Numb in that my face was tingling, but also numb from the realities of being a melancholy teenage boy filled with fear and self loathing.  It was as if my insecurities were just an April downpour pattering away on a roof while I was inside, warm and dry.  My drinking escalated along with my decline in mental health.  I had some people who cared about me.  I was in the power lifting club and there were some nice upperclassman there, the boy in my political philosophy class I used to debate with, and this girl I used to talk to. She was so perfect.  When I'd be sitting somewhere she used to just always appear somehow.  She just made me feel calm.  One night she asked me to ""study"" with her in the library at 2 am.  We were alone and she said she was ""hot"" and pulled up her shirt and moved toward me.  I just left.  I thought she was playing a prank on me.  There was no way a girl like that could be into me.  I still miss her.

Around this time incels started to appear more and more.  I was really disgusted by them.  I was worried that if I was a virgin I was like them.  I downloaded a dating app and that night I met woman that I didn't even know.  The sex was terrible.  The next day I felt lower than low.  It turns out that I had gotten chlamydia.  I felt so gross.  I was paranoid that I had herpes and AIDs too and that I'd be alone forever like a leper.  To this day I can't feel anything during orgasms when I'm with a girl.  The days following were a blur.  All I could hear was this static in my ears.  I would get blackout drunk all the time.  One time  I passed out in the common room and my roommates found me on the floor.  They put me in the recovery position.  I was so embarrassed and still cringe about that. Paranoia was an issue. One time the RA called me to his office.  I thought there were going to be two campus cops there to commit me and that I'd have to make them shoot me to not get taken alive.  There wasn't.  He was very nice.  Another girl I met on tinder was very sweet but I just felt uneasy when we had sex.  She had her issues though.  She would get upset when I went to the gym because she was worried I would get too attractive and dump her.  I dropped out after that.

The next few years were bad.  I just kind of floated around.  I became an EMT at one point, but I quit because the pay was only $11.50/hr and I made $15/hr at whole foods.  The downward spiral came.  The drinking, the violence, the self hatred, and the regret.  Finally I was sleeping in my truck.  There was just nothing left.  Eventually I ended up in a detox followed by being in and out of a psych ward.  I received electroconvulsive therapy which worked wonders.  Finally I felt like I could get my life together.  I did something really stupid though.  After an argument I stormed out of my Mom's, got really drunk, and drove.  Everything could be good but then it would just hit.  Rage, terror, and despair.  Instinct tells me to run, bur I can't outrun something that's inside me so I just roll around on my bed.  When not that, the fog will just roll in and my brain won't work.  I was contemplating suicide.  I had a handgun and put it in my mouth.  I felt myself starting to squeeze the trigger.  Millimeters from oblivion but I thought twice.  Then the cops pulled me over.  They cuffed me, but beat the shit out of me back at the jail.  I wanna be tough but they are in my nightmares. Sometimes I wake up screaming. The officer’s eyes have the glint of an almost erotic rapture of violence. He smiles. I made his night. I’ve seen those eyes before. They are the eyes of the gang member from rehab who shot someone in the face. I’m grabbed again and shoved along back to the cruiser. The world becomes blurry. They even charged me with criminal mischief for bleeding all over the the seats when they brought me to the hospital.  Right through the ambulance bay I used to bring patients through.

The arrest motivated me.  I got my drinking under control. I went back to school.  I have a 3.8 gpa now and I'm in my junior year and plan to go to law school.  I'm so scared though.  Its so hard to find motivation. The Corona virus hit just after I got back on my feet after the arrest.  I've been so alone.  I feel like a loser.  I don't bother with online dating because hookups just made me feel empty.  I just want someone to be the big spoon and whisper into my ear.  On the days when the fog is in and I can't do my assignments I'm so scared.  All I can see is the bottom rushing up at me. I'm scared I'll end up on the street.  I was getting maintenance ECT treatments every 5-6 weeks but it made it so hard to think and I was burned out.  ECT helped but it did take a part of me.  What keeps me grounded is my power lifting routine. Lifting heavy things, making sick gainz, and building my armor.  I feel like I'll be forever alone with this isolation.  There is a girl who comes and talks to me at work.  I worry if I ask her out it will start drama and I will lose my job.  This post makes me feel guilty.

What keeps me grounded is my power lifting routine. Lifting heavy things, making sick gainz, and building my armor.  I feel like I&amp;#39;ll be forever alone with this isolation.  There is a girl who comes and talks to me at work.  I worry if I ask her out it will start drama and I will lose my job.  This post makes me feel guilty. I just complain to strangers on the internet.  Do I like being this way?  I hate myself so fucking much.&lt;/p&gt;

So I adopted a cat this past Saturday. She is a gorgeous 3 month old calico. A kitten, so fulllll of energy.

I am feeling so inadequate taking care of her. I feel absolutely horrible. I am playing with her, but I get tired so fast. I keep playing until she gets tired though.  At night, it looks like she likes playing by herself and exploring alone more, so I let her be.

But I feel absolutely horrible. She isnt me pooping in  her box which is stressful. Working on that.

Everyone talks about how their pet saved their life. I just feel so stressed. I’m stressing about everything. I can’t get work done. I just feel so stressed and overwhelmed. Idk how she will save my life cuz all I feel is more despair and I feel like I am a horrible mother to the cat and I shouldn’t have adopted her in the first place (I won’t dump her of course.

,depression,"I know this is nothing new here. But I'm really upset right now. 

I feel like all of my friends hate me. I feel like everyone I walk by is staring at me. I feel like everyone thinks I'm creepy because I dont talk to anyone. I feel like people don't want to talk to me. I feel like everyone ignores me when I talk to them. I feel like I cant even begin conversations with new people because I'm afraid they dont want to talk to me. I feel afraid because I dont want to be ""that guy"" that joins in friend groups that nobody wants me in. I feel like people are laughing at me. I feel like my teachers find me weird because I never talk to anyone around me. I feel like my best friends made new friends when they were in-person and I was virtual at school, and now they dont like me anymore. I feel afraid that I'll be told one day that my best friends want to move on from me, and I'll have no one else to fall back on. I worry that people think I'm like this for attention. I feel like people don't like my sense of humor, how quiet I am, how annoying I am....

This is how I feel every day. I always tell people I dont care what others think about me, but now I feel like I've been putting on a mask over how I actually am. I'm a shy, insecure, anxious kid. I was always told that high school was when you meet a bunch of new friends and it's the most fun time of school ever with new people. But that hasn't happened yet. I'm too scared to talk to anyone. Recently, I started sitting at lunch with a friend I havent seen in person since the start of the pandemic. She sits with 3 other people, two of which I already know, but there was someone new I've never met before. She is super nice and laughs at all of the stuff other people say. So, I tried to talk to her, and she just kind of ignored me. She just talked to my other friends instead of me. I tried cracking jokes in the conversations, trying to be a part of something, but I just ended up feeling like no one wanted me there. I feel like I'm invading a friend group that everyone was happy with before I got there. I honestly just want to sit alone during lunch because of this, but I feel bad about it because I have friends to talk to, I'm just afraid to talk to them. I'm too afraid to talk to anyone. I'm too afraid to do anything.


 My anxiety has never been this bad before, but I think the length of the pandemic and how it affected me has made me scared of socializing at all. I'm too afraid of rejection, and I dont want to be annoying to anyone. I just want friends at school.

 I want a friend that makes me laugh and I can make them laugh. I want a friend that I can walk with to my classes. I want a friend that I'm super close to, but i dont feel like that with any of my friends. I used to be really close with all of my friends, but now I just feel separated. My biggest fear is being considered annoying. And I feel like EVERYONE thinks I'm annoying.

,depression,"I’m a junior in high school, if that matters at all.

These past few months have easily been the worst of my life. I’ve never felt so low mentally. My depression has never been worse. My anxiety has never been so bad. I’ve never had so many suicidal thoughts.

It’s no wonder why I can’t do school right now. I’m too busy constantly fighting with my own head and trying to just feel okay and stable enough to get through the day. 

I’ve been struggling with school ever since November. Right now I have about 50 overdue items and that isn’t an exaggeration, most of them are just short quizzes but it’s still horrible. Ive never been the most motivated in school, but damn I’ve never been this low.

I’m failing every single class but one right now. The only reason I’m passing one class is because I kept getting scheduled for help meetings with my teacher and I started to feel so guilty that I just finally did the work for that class so I wouldn’t have to go to those meetings anymore. 

I’m scheduled for several help meetings with my teachers every week and now I have a meeting with my advisor this week too to discuss my grades. I can’t help but feel like my teachers hate me because I turn in everything late, if I even turn it in at all. A lot of them are really understanding of my situation but I feel so embarrassed.

I want to do good in school but I don’t have the motivation at all. Right now my homework is open on my computer and I just can’t bring myself to do it because it feels like too much. I’m so behind. The thought of doing homework makes me wanna cry. The best way I can describe it is I just feel too tired to do it. Like mentally tired? Idk. And it hurts so much.

&lt;p&gt;These past few months have easily been the worst of my life. I’ve never felt so low mentally. My depression has never been worse. My anxiety has never been so bad. I’ve never had so many suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no wonder why I can’t do school right now. I’m too busy constantly fighting with my own head and trying to just feel okay and stable enough to get through the day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been struggling with school ever since November. Right now I have about 50 overdue items and that isn’t an exaggeration, most of them are just short quizzes but it’s still horrible. Ive never been the most motivated in school, but damn I’ve never been this low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m failing every single class but one right now. The only reason I’m passing one class is because I kept getting scheduled for help meetings with my teacher and I started to feel so guilty that I just finally did the work for that class so I wouldn’t have to go to those meetings anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m scheduled for several help meetings with my teachers every week and now I have a meeting with my advisor this week too to discuss my grades. I can’t help but feel like my teachers hate me because I turn in everything late, if I even turn it in at all. A lot of them are really understanding of my situation but I feel so embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to do good in school but I don’t have the motivation at all. Right now my homework is open on my computer and I just can’t bring myself to do it because it feels like too much. I’m so behind. The thought of doing homework makes me wanna cry. The best way I can describe it is I just feel too tired to do it. Like mentally tired? Idk. And it hurts so much. &lt;/p&gt;

Eventually I matched with this girl, I invited her to my home and we had protected sex but I'm extremely fucking paranoid that I didn't use the condom properly or analyze it thoroughly after, I think I mightve put the condom on the wrong way inside out and I noticed that when I came, it didnt all pool to the bottom of the condom and it kind of went UP towards the base of the condom so what I didnt give it enough room and some leaked out the base? Also I think my sperm is HIGHLY FERTILE due to the inclusion of eggs, pumpkin seeds, broccoli  in diet and my daily intense weightlifting/cardio regime. 

After she left, I got paranoid and deleted my tinder because I didnt want to risk hooking up with anymore girls and possibly impregnating them but this only makes things worse because WE CANT CONTACT eachother.

So I have no choice but to endure this AGNOZING MENTAL TORTURE for weeks and  months hoping that I won't get a knock on my door, and even then she might carry out the full term pregnancy without contacting me to the very end.

I have inherited serious mental illnesses from parents and grandparents. If I went to a psychiatrist I'd be diagnosed as clinically insane.

Pre pandemic all I did was stay home the vast majority of the time. My actual time spent at home hasn’t changed that much. And it won’t change when everything goes back to “normal”. 

Ive joked about it before but I realized it’s actually true. “Normal” means nothing to me as my life in 2020 was basically the same as it was in 2019 and 2018. 

People around me are getting excited for things to go back and you can really sense their anticipation and the excitement. I mean you can sense it everywhere, people are gonna rejoice when this shit is over with and it’ll probably be a joyous time for the whole world. 

I’ll be happy too, no doubt. Happy that we don’t have to worry as much about all the deaths and happy that so many people can get back to normalcy and we can put this rough era behind us. I’m not proud to say it but that happiness will fade pretty quickly cuz eventually I’ll have to face my own self. Like I do every single morning when I make my daily calculation and rumination that help me decide whether or not living is worth it on this particular rotation of the burning gas ball in the sky

There’s no parties that I’ll be invited to, for me there’s nothing to celebrate.

,depression,"I hate posting this because I don't feel like it is worth posting.  At the same time... I'm just running out of hope.

I am just....tired.  Tired of the daily struggle.  Tired of acting like everything is fine.  Tired of trying.

,depression,"I just failed the exam for my drivers license, to most people this would be pretty dissapointing.

To someone who basically ripped their \*ss open and did nothing else than study for weeks on end, while struggeling with not getting enough sleep for years, not having enough motivation to eat, only forgetting and never being able to learn sh\*t no matter how hard they try. Being isolated for years while constantly being shredded to pieces by their abusive mother and praying to god that something will happen so that I don't have to keep living.  
All this while finally building up the courage to go and take the exam, only to fail and having to listen to ""you didnt even try"", ""it won't be any different next time"".

It's not like this just now. It hasn't been like this since last year. Stuff like this is happening to me all the time and each and everytime people tell me ""this is easy there's no way you can fail"", ""this isn't hard"" or what not. I always wonder why. Why do I always fail if everything is so god damn easy. 

Why am I stuck in life while everyone else keeps going.

I can't even have a few minutes to myself because my mother doesn't understand that I need some time for myself right now to cool down. I hate that I'm reacting so extreme to all this but being yelled at doesn't help

Everything is a waste of energy and I don't know of any reason to keep doing this sh\*t when all I do is fail no matter how hard I try.

&lt;p&gt;To someone who basically ripped their *ss open and did nothing else than study for weeks on end, while struggeling with not getting enough sleep for years, not having enough motivation to eat, only forgetting and never being able to learn sh*t no matter how hard they try. Being isolated for years while constantly being shredded to pieces by their abusive mother and praying to god that something will happen so that I don&amp;#39;t have to keep living.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like this just now. It hasn&amp;#39;t been like this since last year.

I always wonder why. Why do I always fail if everything is so god damn easy. &lt;/p&gt;

I have to imagine that I'm in a similar situation to a number of people here. I was a ""gifted"" child, and now I'm a fuck up of an adult.

I impulsively buy anything that I think might bring me any sort of positive emotion- technology, clothes, trips, drugs- and without much income, I have accrued a large amount of debt very quickly.

I'm guessing I'm not the only person who believed people when they said ""excellence in a STEM field will lead to a lucrative and fulfilling career."" Now I have a job as effectively a glorified sign, and can barely even focus on that because of how much I want to kill myself, and how much I dont want to break down in tears in public.

What I'm looking for is a job that requires technical skills and my lack of self-preservation instinct would be advantageous.

I impulsively buy anything that I think might bring me any sort of positive emotion- technology, clothes, trips, drugs- and without much income, I have accrued a large amount of debt very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m guessing I&amp;#39;m not the only person who believed people when they said &amp;quot;excellence in a STEM field will lead to a lucrative and fulfilling career.&amp;quot; Now I have a job as effectively a glorified sign, and can barely even focus on that because of how much I want to kill myself, and how much I dont want to break down in tears in public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m looking for is a job that requires technical skills and my lack of self-preservation instinct would be advantageous. I wanted to become an army sapper but after looking at my medical history (psych stuff), they may have set a record for fastest deny in military history. As far as location, my engagement just collapsed to an irreparable level, so I have no tether.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"sorry this may be a bit of a long read. i appreciate any feedback you can give me. i wasnt sure where to post this but thank you for anyone who takes the time to read.

i think depression might be ruining my relationship, but i dont know for certain. 

I (25m) have been doing long distance with a girl (26f) for about 4-5 years, and i tend to have one issue come up every once in awhile. Finding attraction for another person, thinking like ""i could be happier with that person).

at most just a simple crush, but it will make me start rethinking my current relationship. i ask myself why am I feeling this way? i dont know anything about this person but i may feel fluttery thinking about them, generic crush feelings. for some reason i think that i might be happier with someone else. but there's not anything wrong with my current relationship, it's great (but maybe with someone else it's better?).

My emotions will flow from ""i think my gf is the one, I want to propose"" to me being unsure and potentially looking at other dating options.

I guess a little info that may be relevant. This is my first relationship ever, and ive had depression and OCD my whole life. our first year dating was great, but i was having second thoughts in combination with some pretty deep depression. i had pretty much just decided I'd let the relationship wither and then probably kill myself several years later since i just dont feel cut out for life. my neglect led her to break up with me first. at this point i was a few weeks away from moving back to my own country, but emotions hit me hard and i suddenly had an intense feeling that i needed her and that i do actually want to live. we got back together and started long distance. every few months or so I start second guessing our relationship again, only to eventually return back to thinking she is the one and wanting to finally close the distance. a couple times when things were difficult i would get worried about potentially losing her in the future and panicking, immediately reverting whatever my thoughts were at the time to love and need to be with her. but eventually crushing on someone else and my head getting messy again.

As I've never been in a relationship prior to this one, i have no idea what to think of all this. is this just what dating is like with depression and OCD? is this a normal issue with long distance relationships? and why the hell do i crush on others so easily? not even like an obtainable person like i could be crushing on an idol suddenly and it would make me question my feelings for my girlfriend. but the moment im scared of losing my gf all this goes away.

I want to think that closing the distance would solve these problems, but i just don't know. 

i guess one more note, i believed myself to be demisexual for quite a long time. i often wouldn't develop strong feelings for someone unless i really got to know them and had the time to fall for their personality. girls i fell for in the past were girls who i started out as friends and after a year or 2 i developed strong feelings for them but got rejected. ive not asked out many girls in my life at all, again they just didnt appeal to me much until i already had a deep history with them. at some point this started to change and i was able to feel a much larger range of emotions for people i didnt know at all. maybe a year or so after that started i ended up with my gf. i have no idea if this is relevant.

as for the depression, i have no idea what i want out of life. i always thought i wanted success, friends, money, and a beautiful gf. i have all of those things now, and im no happier. i am constantly debating in my head what im missing or what i need to do to become happy. maybe that contributes to why I will suddenly fantasize about like with another girl.

there is always something im depressed about, and if i get over it or resolve an issue, then ill look for something else to blame. last week i was depressed about my hobbies and work, this week i seem to think my relationship is missing something i could get with someone else and that i could then be happy (not that i could tell you give u an example of what ""difference"" i think would help).

,depression,"I suffer from depression and social anxiety since I was 15 (now 21).

I started Amitriptyline 50mg on 18th Dec 2020. No effects. Increased to 100mg on 15th Jan 2021. No effects... until 3 days ago. 

The last 3 days I felt very calm and relaxed. Less depressive thoughts. Social anxiety still present but I’m completely fine with being introverted. I‘m completely fine with being myself just like I am. Everything seems okay just where it is. I’m good. Not perfect but who is? 

Now I don‘t know if it‘s the Amitriptyline as normally an antidepressant should start showing effects after 2-4 weeks. Now it’s 2 months later after my increased dose to 100mg. 3 days ago when I started feeling better I also started a stack of supplements so maybe it‘s the stack only and the Amitriptyline still does nothing for my depression.

Is it possible that an antidepressant first starts working so late, after 2 months of the increased dose? 

I have to decide if I should taper off Amitriptyline now or if it‘s the Amitriptyline making me feel that calm. Right now I‘m thinking it‘s probably my stack of supplements making me feel that calm because I started it 3 days ago and since 3 days I‘m less depressed.

EDIT:
My plan for now:

&lt;p&gt;I started Amitriptyline 50mg on 18th Dec 2020. No effects. Increased to 100mg on 15th Jan 2021. No effects... until 3 days ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last 3 days I felt very calm and relaxed. Less depressive thoughts. Social anxiety still present but I’m completely fine with being introverted. I‘m completely fine with being myself just like I am. Everything seems okay just where it is. I’m good. Not perfect but who is? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I don‘t know if it‘s the Amitriptyline as normally an antidepressant should start showing effects after 2-4 weeks. Now it’s 2 months later after my increased dose to 100mg. 3 days ago when I started feeling better I also started a stack of supplements so maybe it‘s the stack only and the Amitriptyline still does nothing for my depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible that an antidepressant first starts working so late, after 2 months of the increased dose? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to decide if I should taper off Amitriptyline now or if it‘s the Amitriptyline making me feel that calm. Right now I‘m thinking it‘s probably my stack of supplements making me feel that calm because I started it 3 days ago and since 3 days I‘m less depressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:
My plan for now:
I now taper and took 75mg the last two nights as my doc told me to. If my mental health gets worse now on 75mg/50mg/25mg etc. (reduced taper doses) I know that it was the Amitriptyline helping me and I will go back to 100mg.

,depression,"Hey all,

So a brief summary thus far. After graduation I went into legal and qualified as a lawyer, held it for 4 years before my skin got a lil too thin, I burnt out after continual 80 hour weeks and then decided to take a retail job which of course gouged my earnings but, honestly for the most part I was happy.

The employers weren't good people and after realizing that I took a chance at a large company in Germany without knowing the language or a single soul there. It's been a year now, I've been in lockdown here for what is now approaching 8 months or so, and I am now officially referred to as a ""junior project manager"" within IT. My German has improved, I have made friends, my flat feels homely.

The staff are friendly, the wage is good and I'm often reminded by others just how fortunate I am to 1, be chosen amongst others who can indeed speak German, 2 I'm in a new country and working and getting to experience a new culture and 3, You're getting qualified as you earn in a new career path.

But I'd be lying if I said I was happy. My day consists of what feels like glorified admin work, I'm forgotten in meetings, new yearly review has passed without any mention, the IT work isn't dull, but I don't share the burning passion my colleagues do. Colleagues and management don't often pass remarks but when they do it amounts to ""yeah, you're doing fine"" - yet I don't feel secure. Right now I just feel lost, I've no motivation to get up each day and feign interest, but to leave would be ""such a shame"", ""you'd be throwing away a once in a lifetime chance"", ""you've not worked long enough to try and find somewhere else"".

Can I please get some advice on this? I'm 29 for reference and I've suffered with depression in the past. I know full well, people are losing jobs by the day, companies are going under and the whole world is struggling; I don't like making this seem like an entitled post.

haven't had a good day in years...
whatever I try to do I fail... nothing comes easy to me... can't solve a problem without creating another one... i feel like everything I say, do or think is wrong... the smallest things frustrate me.
I'm having repetitive thoughts, feelings and fears that never belonged to me and are so far from what I feel like my original self is or was.
I'm full of hate and rage and envy and shame and I dont like who Im becoming... I feel like I made every mistake I could make and had every wrong tought I could have. At times it feels like god hates me
I cant seem to make peace with my past although it was never really in my control... i was always surrounded by idiots, I just can't stop dwelling... can't escape this endless loop
I feel damaged beyond repair...
am I too good or too bad for this world? idk but i do know i dont belong here... I hate this shithole world anyway... where so many dickheads and assholes  become heroes and rise to the top and good fuckers become bad wtf is this shit... I'm a worthless piece of shit and want to end myself... cant stand my breath, my voice, my thoughts... I hate myself I hate everything... I hate being on this side of life, it sucks.
 the whole day was full with frustrations(like every day) What triggered me to write this post tho is  losing my house keys and headphones...
Suicide's been on my mind a lot and it seems that everything that happens to me is an affirmation from god(like, yes, kill yourself). Been in this place for like 5 years and havent had a good cry since like 15.
Also, why is there such a high rate of unsuccessful suicide attempts? All it takes is one second of madness and bravery when you see the train coming and boy, does it feel like I'm mad...

,depression,"Hello 

My name is Carl, and you probably won't read this in full. That's not my real name, because I dont like my real name anyways. 

This might bore you, but at this point I'll take anything to speak to someone. I'm tired. Im tired of saying I'm tired and I'm tired of telling other people I'm tired. But you don't know why, and as answer stranger on the internet, you will never know truly, because not even I know. I will, let you in to some of it. 

These words are pretentious. I keep trying to say something that makes sense, but it reads like an amateur essay, for that, I'm sorry. That's another thing I'm tired of saying. My two catchphrases, I'm tired and I'm sorry. Make mistakes at work, forgot to call mom today, didn't get milk or take out the trash, I'm always sorry. 


I live a hundred lives. In my mind, I'm a singer, a great designer, an artist, a writer. Today, I had an interview just in my head alone. Tomorrow, I'll get ready for a photoshoot and a magazine interview that won't ever happen. I dare to give myself importance in another reality. I exhaust myself listening to songs that amplify my heartbeat, and lay on my bed, sweating because of nothing at all. 

I live the same day over and over. Please understand I've tried. Tried the hobbies, the change in diets, and I can't ever commit to anything. My gym membership has been half filled for months, my vegetables rot in the fridge, books I've bought and now use as coasters. Ive made commitments and promises I'll ether keep or do half way.. Even if I did these things, what would they be masking? 

There's this movie I saw. Its on Netflix, ""I'm thinking of ending things"". Ironically enough, the melancholy of it resonates so much with me, having a utilitarian life without purpose. Not so much the love part, although I am also guilty of that. I hold conversations with my perfect spouse, in my head, about how we love each other and understand. He's sitting with me in the car, holding my hand sometimes. In reality, he's some trash bags in the passenger seat I haven't taken care of. 

I wish I had a point when writing this, but I don't. It's word salad. I'm tired, lonely and unhappy. I have bad dreams, a bad feeling in my stomach when I wake up, like I'm never really home, even if I'm in my apartment. I get headaches and get so bored at work even if the work itself is engaging. They're not the problem, I am. Every day is the same. 

I've probably forgotten some things, but this is long enough as is.

My gym membership has been half filled for months, my vegetables rot in the fridge, books I&amp;#39;ve bought and now use as coasters. Ive made commitments and promises I&amp;#39;ll ether keep or do half way.. Even if I did these things, what would they be masking? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s this movie I saw. Its on Netflix, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m thinking of ending things&amp;quot;. Ironically enough, the melancholy of it resonates so much with me, having a utilitarian life without purpose. Not so much the love part, although I am also guilty of that. I hold conversations with my perfect spouse, in my head, about how we love each other and understand. He&amp;#39;s sitting with me in the car, holding my hand sometimes. In reality, he&amp;#39;s some trash bags in the passenger seat I haven&amp;#39;t taken care of. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I had a point when writing this, but I don&amp;#39;t. It&amp;#39;s word salad. I&amp;#39;m tired, lonely and unhappy. I have bad dreams, a bad feeling in my stomach when I wake up, like I&amp;#39;m never really home, even if I&amp;#39;m in my apartment. I get headaches and get so bored at work even if the work itself is engaging. They&amp;#39;re not the problem, I am. Every day is the same. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve probably forgotten some things, but this is long enough as is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help me understand what is there to see and to look forward to. Have you been this same person that I am today? How did you get out of it? How did you get stuck?&lt;/p&gt;

                                          Whenever you start a new book,meet the characters,it's like making new friends.And you get so attached that when you stop reading,and are away from them even for a bit,you are reminded of your reality again,and the loneliness that envelopes it.This might not sound like much,but lately this thought has shattered my existence.I have some friends in real life,people who i've met,when I was a kid,when it was easier to make friends, but as i've grown,it's become harder to keep in touch with them.Moreover,I haven't made a single close friend since highschool.Lots of acquaintances that if you ask them,they'll tell we're friends; good guys,too.But I simply can't connect anymore,not even with people with similar interests.But then,I pick up a book,and befriend the characters,and forget about myself for the time.

 I just finished,the Tv series,His Dark Materials. And I feel like crying.Me,a 20 something felt a connection to the 12 year old protagonist and armoured bear,that I haven't felt in ages to my friends or classmates.How pathetic is that!Now that i'm conscious of this,I don't think I can pick up another story and enjoy it to the fullest,knowing that the only reason I read now is to distract myself from my miserable existence.

                                          Whenever you start a new book,meet the characters,it&amp;#39;s like making new friends.And you get so attached that when you stop reading,and are away from them even for a bit,you are reminded of your reality again,and the loneliness that envelopes it.This might not sound like much,but lately this thought has shattered my existence.I have some friends in real life,people who i&amp;#39;ve met,when I was a kid,when it was easier to make friends, but as i&amp;#39;ve grown,it&amp;#39;s become harder to keep in touch with them.Moreover,I haven&amp;#39;t made a single close friend since highschool.Lots of acquaintances that if you ask them,they&amp;#39;ll tell we&amp;#39;re friends; good guys,too.But I simply can&amp;#39;t connect anymore,not even with people with similar interests.But then,I pick up a book,and befriend the characters,and forget about myself for the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just finished,the Tv series,His Dark Materials. And I feel like crying.Me,a 20 something felt a connection to the 12 year old protagonist and armoured bear,that I haven&amp;#39;t felt in ages to my friends or classmates.How pathetic is that!Now that i&amp;#39;m conscious of this,I don&amp;#39;t think I can pick up another story and enjoy it to the fullest,knowing that the only reason I read now is to distract myself from my miserable existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway,that&amp;#39;s my rant.Thank you if you&amp;#39;re reading.Have a good day!!&lt;/p&gt;

Suffered from clinical depression from 4 years now, but i assume it was a bit longer than that actually. Introverted and with an empathy through the roof, i can put a sort of functioning facade that comes at the expense of a huge amount of energy. I honestly have been struggling with work for 10 years now, bouncing from job to job, even had been doing some interesting stuff, but could never build any kind of skill beyond a shallow level. Those things  i am truly interested into are just not feasible careers as there s no money in it. Was lucky to have people taking care of me, but after the last  time i have been hospitalized and1 year of therapy, thousands of cvs sent (in a smart way, with cover letters, personalized according to the employers) i am just as low as 4 years ago. My CV now after 10 years is obviously a mess and it is not  employable. I always felt like i did not have any value, and gave my time for free or was barely paid, obviously a selfesteem problem. It took me 1 month to pick up a phone and try to do something as basic as negotiate a service i needed to receive, which actually completely backfired.

Whatever it is, i always feel like i am being a bother to anyone i have an interaction with or trying to make an injustice towards the person i am talking to, like if i was not deserving of anything and the Other should always have priority before me. Tried to look for job openings today and i had to go back to benzos (which i am supposed to take always but am scared of going overboard and becoming addicted) right away because even looking at just a  job profile would skyrocket my anxiety.

I cant kill myself because i have a family and the idea of bringing such pain to them is unbearable, so im stuck in this purgatory of a fake, shell of an existence, feeling the passive aggressive judgement of others and therefore self-isolating even more. I have left my place maybe 10 times in 8 months,  mostly for groceries or bureaucratic stuff (to be fair corona was partly an issue for that).

,depression,"I'm a freshman in hs right now, and still early third trimester. I used to love going to school to escape the stress of my parents at home, but recently I cant find an escape unless I'm either home alone or by myself walking through town. 

At school, I used to always have fun and laugh with my friends and it felt great. Recently everything feels somewhat forced. It's like when you're mad and someone says a joke that makes you, but you still are fucjing passed at them. It just doesn't feel natural to be happy anymore. Everything is just kind of mediocre or bleh/meh. 

Anytime I hang around my friends now to, they all are just different. It feels like I'm always that friend who's the third option for partners. They both look at each other, and I'm just kind of left behind. 

I recently broke up with my girlfriend, but it wasn't like a huge break up. For the past week I hadn't really felt anything and so I called her and we broke up(I don't rlly wanna get into that it's not complicated, just long and dull). I was talking about this with a female friend, and she told me she felt bad for me, but that she doesn't rlly see me as someone with a girlfriend or in a relationship like that. That kind of stung. I don't hold anything against her she is kind of dumb but rlly means well. 

I just don't feel like I belong at the school I go to, or the ppl I hang around. There is probably only 2 friends of mine that I consider genuine brothers to me. One goes to the same school as me, and the other goes to one about 45 min away. I know for a fact that the one at school with me feels the same way as me, bc we've talked about it before. I don't know if he feels as hopeless as me tho. 

I look around at school, and see the different friend groups. You have the alternative crowd, the liberal girl squad, goody two shoes, popular kids and all. I've done sports all my life, and that's what all the popular kids do so I've gotten to know them well, but sometimes they just treat me like some creep. I've been walking around my head down recently just because I'd rather do that than look at people who can't look me in the eyes, and one of the popular kids who I am on good terms with just said I looked like a creep. I don't let them see how that makes me feel, but it makes me feel like someone who doesn't belong. 

I couldn't tell you whether or not I want to be left alone my whole life, but part of me wants that. If people could stop making me happy for short periods of time, I wouldn't have anything to hope for and maybe that would be better. My parents say I'm going going go far, and currently I want to be a copyright or intellectual property lawyer, but recently I don't know what I want to be. I don't rlly know who I am either. I don't know if am rlly an emo (seeing as I've cut my wrists before I think I am) or some retarded kid who makes the occasional funny comment, or someone who doesn't give give shit or anything. There's a saying that a jack of all trades is master of none, meaning that you could be decent at everything, but nothing outstanding or anything anything specific. That's what it feels like kind of. Just not bad at school, but I'm no 4.5 GPA kid. I'm not a bad lineman in ftball, but nothing outstanding. I'm good probably at making cringe or awkward comments and that's it. Again, I just feel like I don't belong.

Fucking hell I'm writing out my whole fucking life on reddit I don't have any girlfriend or parent or friend that I feel could actually just hold me for a minute and say it'll be better. That's all I want. Is to fucking much to ask for? Just some good luck for a fucking change. Lemme find something to be great at or something. Idk. I just feel hopeless and like a pile of shit. If you read this whole thing, thanks I guess. I just need a place or someone to talk to on a genuine level.

,depression,"Hi everyone i'm new on reddit and i just really nedeed a place to vent, so sorry if i'm not posting this on the right subreddit. By the way since english isn't my native language i might be doing lots of mistakes, so let me just apologize in advance if that ever happens.

So concretely... i don't even know where to start from. I'm a 26 year old men (almost 27) i've been unemployed for like a year now, i'm living with my parents and my sister and... i don't know i really feel like a huge and pathetic piece of useless garbage 90% of the time. And i think there's different reasons to why i'm feeling that way, although i'm not even sure myself if those are the potential reasons. And it's also quite strange that i'm gonna consider that a ""good day"" for me would be a day where i didn't have any suicidal thoughts.

Like i don't know i just feel so bad about myself because first of all i'm living with my parents at 26, i've never been in a relationship with a women in my whole life, i only worked for like 2 years in my whole life and i don't feel like i ever had stable relationships with people/friends. That + the fact that i'm living in a capitalistic world where first of all there's no place for feelings, empathy and ""weak"" people like me (especially when you're a man), and where you also have to sell your time and body to a psychopat/sociopath of a boss for 40 + years of your goddamn life.

So in other words what i mean is that the reasons i feel so bad about myself is probably because of behavioral/personal reasons that's for sure, but then also for enviromental reasons.

And i also feel like there is something that's really deeply wrong with me, because how is it that almost everyone around me seems to be adapting really well to society and i don't ? Why am i always the one struggling ? And why do i always feel so lost in life ?

So to try and discover that i've been to 2 different therapist and they both came to the same conclusion after multiple therapy sessions : ""yeah well you seem to be a highly sensitive person, and you know it really is a gift to be the way you are ! So i'm gonna give you this book right here that explains how you should deal with that peculiarity of yours"". 

Well thanks gee, so in other words that's a way of saying ""oh well you know you're senstive, that sucks and all but who cares you're gonna have to adapt to this garbage-ass world anyways buddy"".

Well... i don't really know if feeling negative emotions 100x times deeper and harder than the average neuro-typical person is a gift because like... it fucking hurts me ?

And i don't know when i look into myself i'm just seeing someone that's full of uncertainty, insecurity and soo anxious about life and living. I'm actually in a really weird spot where i'm too much of a coward to be living life at maximum potential, but i'm also too much of a coward to just suicide and end all of my misery and suffering once and for all. 

And it's just pathetic how everytime that i'm facing a highly stressfull/anxious situations i just feel like immediately giving up on everything, come back home lie in my bed and just start crying over how useless and pathetic i am for being that way. Like everytime i'm trying to get my act together by doing an apprenticeship or applying for jobs or whatever i just immediately feel like sabotage myself like this : ""why the fuck would i even bother trying"", ""why would anyone pick me for a job where thousands of other people are applying"", etc...

I don't know like i'm just soo disgusted with myself and my behavior, i feel like i'm a baby in the body of a 26 years old who can't stop crying, complaining and whining everytime life gets a bit too hard.

I also wanted to talk about something else, i don't know if this is gonna help you guys but i have done the ""16 personnalities"" test many times and it seems that i'm an INFP (i also get INTJ sometimes but when i read the description i feel like i'm more of an INFP).

And even when i'm trying to discuss all those feelings and problems i'm having in life with my parents for example, they will say something like ""what are we gonna do with you son ?"" or my mom is gonna say ""you've always been so difficult even when you were a kid"" or ""hurry up you wasted so many years of your life now it's time to catch up""... Yeah thanks mom it's not like i was hurting myself enough with all those kinds of judgemental thoughts so you just had to add your judgement aswell. 

And that's also why i'm avoiding talking about all those things with anyone because most of the time it doesn't even make me feel better to talk about it, it just makes me feel even worse because i think that it makes me look so weak and pathetic to bother people with my life problems.

And also this may be feeling like a bit off-topic, but i recently watched an anime called Neon Genesis Evangelion because Shinji (the protaganist) is also an INFP and damn... i'm just exactly like him, that's exactly who i am. And it's strange because i felt so sad for the guy on many occassions, but i also felt a bit better knowing that there are people (even if this one is fictionnal) that are like me.

I have no redeeming qualities whatsoever, not a single one. Everyone that's ever been in contact with me has suffered because of it, and will likely continue to suffer. The only person who loves me unconditionally is my own mother, but that's only because I happen to be her son. If I wasn't, she would have told me to fuck off a long time ago.

I have no goals, no ambitions, no dreams— all of those were crushed into fine dust a long time ago. I wanted to marry a nice girl who loved me for me, to eventually get a job and buy a house and do things normal people do. However, even something as basic as that is completely alien to me. What girl in her right mind would ever love someone like me? I used to jerk off to the idea of having a loving girlfriend, but I can't even do that anymore since it's far too unrealistic. (all of my sexual fantasies involve prostitutes now, since the only way a woman would ever touch me if she was paid to do it) I'll never be able to get a job because not only did I drop out of high school due to depression, I can never imagine myself holding a job. I can't even get myself to get out of bed half the time, let alone go to work. I'm also far too anxious to drive a car and I'm absolute shit at following directions and meeting deadlines. Even if I wasn't, most jobs involve interacting with other people, and I'm far too deficient to do that without having a panic attack. As you can see, I am 22 years old yet literal children are more 'adult' than I will ever be.

I have no hobbies or interests aside from video games, and even that is starting to get on my nerves. I've given up on every single hobby I've once had due to realizing that I'm not really good at anything. What's the point? 

I have no motivation to even exist. I've stopped showering, brushing my teeth, or doing anything else related to my wellbeing. What exactly is the point? I am already repulsive, so why should I take care of myself? Just to survive? If it was up to me, I would have already died a long time ago.

I am sick of coping and pretending that that everything is fine, that I am not actually a lost cause and that everything will solve itself. Deep down, I know that I have no value, I know that the world would be better off if I didn't exist. (one less parasite, amirite?) I know I'll never be normal, I know that everyone is better than me. I don't even have a single real life friend, since who in their right mind (aside from taking pity on me) would even want to be anywhere near me? 

I don't know why I'm even typing all of this, but I might as well since I have nothing better to do. 

I need to stop being a fucking pussy and just kill myself already. Every year I keep saying ""I'll do it this year"" but then I just chicken out. (imagine sucking so much that you can't even commit suicide)

,depression,"This might sound weird to a lot of you, I have experienced different kinds f abuse in my life, none of them ever made me feel better in any way about anything.

My life had always been one big.. blur, as if I am not really there, when I was 18 I finally managed to break out of it, meditated, looked into myself and eventually found the peace to be happy.

Soon after I became mysteriously ill, barely able to get out of bed, unable to eat or drink a lot, lost a lot of weight.

It would stay this way over 3 years, slowly starving away, my family didn't believe that something was wrong with me, doctors would just chalk me off as a mental case.

And with the years, I lost hope for betterment, as I watched my body wither away, slowly, my mind however seemed to be clear, I was content with my death, I did not fear it, I was embracing the thought of finally being able to leave this world. 

But it was so much more, I finally knew who I was, I was the only person I really had, completely isolated. With that much time with oneself, you just learn to find the joy in it, you get to know ""each other"".  My mind was clear as ever, not clouded by anything.

Even at the time I feared that IF there would be a solution to my illness and I would get better, hormones and.. life itself would get into the way of this connectedness.

It was when I thought that my time was drawing to a close, that miraculously someone suggested I look into something.. and in the end I was diagnosed with a rare illness, at the time the hospital stay, the surgeries and everything felt just like.. my life, scary but it was simply my reality. Nowadays it is harder to think back.

During my recovery, I remembered looking out the window and expecting to feel.. happy, but I did not, I was making progress, yes, but on the inside I just felt.. overwhelmed and lost, stuck somewhere else, while the world around me keeps turning.

My parents urged me to get a job and leave the house a couple months into my recovery, so I did, I had no choice.

Things got more complicated, I moved to america to the only person who cared about me. 

But all of that in the end just distracted me it feels, because no matter what I do I just feel so... empty, as if I am not even here, still stuck somewhere a couple years ago in my head.


Even the characters that kept my company in my head have started to fade away, my art, my passion, everything has become dull and lifeless, I keep trying to do something, I *want* to do it, but everything just frustrates me the moment I start it.

I have no money, no stability, no more talent than others and no.. joy at all, at 23 I feel like I am set further back than I was at 18.


Even thinking and imagining things, escaping into my fantasy has become hard, as if I ... can't tap into myself anymore, hanging somewhere above me. 

It feels as if I am trapped in a bubble of mud and no matter how hard I try and struggle, punch and kick, I just can't get out, I am just static, frozen in place and.. cannot move.

I don't want to be trapped in this, I want to find me again, I want to be able to feel and.. meet myself, my world and my characters again. I miss being alone, I miss being myself, I miss actually feeling and being able to do the things I love or.. anything, really, I can barely shower myself.

If anyone has any advice, I would be most grateful.

,depression,"So I've been dating my current gf for about 6 months now - we are both 23 and live 2 hours from eachother.

She suffers from clinical depression and anxiety, and really is not in a good place in her life atm.

She has little to no money, is soon to be evicted from her place and forced to live in a house share, can't find a job, can't see anybody because of COVID, and she is overall just very down from what I can tell.

Lately (for the past 2-3 weeks), we really haven't spoken very much - her communication has been on the decrease for a few months now, as when we first met we would talk on the phone several times a week and video call often. 

Now, she never wants to call and we never do video calls - she also isn't great at texting either and just replies little and often, and when she does it's hardly full or energy and interest.  She will just repond to what I have said with two or three words.

Lately I just feel completely detached from my girlfriend - I've told her this and she just says she is 'busy' and has got a lot to deal with rn.

I'm trying my best to respect this, but it is hard because she has been becoming more and more distant with me since the end of last year - and now we are at the point where we barely speak other than a few messages at the end of the day.

I honestly don't know what to do - I can't imagine how difficult her situation must be rn (given that she is dealing with everything I've described alone), but at the same time I'm finding it hard to cope.

I miss her - I miss feeling like she is my GF and not just some pen pal. I've done my best to help her, but living 2 hours away and the COVID Lockdown means I can only do so much.

I felt like a fraud, like my feelings and thoughts were bullshit, like I shouldn&amp;#39;t have said anything or gotten any help. I felt like I was a waste of time. But I have been having problems were I feel this numbness, like I feel no emotions and like I want to do nothing, and I get overwhelmed by the past and all these sentences pass through my mind. Like you deserved what happened to you, he doesn&amp;#39;t like you anymore and no one else does, just quit your job, do nothing, lose everything you shouldn&amp;#39;t have. But in the moment the thoughts seem right, so I don&amp;#39;t get upset about them, just, guilty? I don&amp;#39;t know what emotion it is but it feels kinda like numbness. I wondered if anyone ever felt this&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been thinking past few days. Some have people around them that cares for them, are concerned for them, and genuinely wants them to get better and they help them in their journey. I want that kinda some one too. Like be there for me, break down my walls, care for me genuinely. 

I don’t want people to just listen to me and be like ‘yeah don’t worry, everything will get better or I sometimes feel like that too, oh my I have that too, they will pass’. What if you saw my wrist? What would you say then? Like I know my parents would be extremely mad and call me crazy or maybe be concerned but in angry way. My friends I’m not sure, they would probably look at me differently or pity me or even think I’m crazy for this. My best friend also probably would guilt trip me but he would think that’s the way to help. 

But I want someone to just care. Just be concerned for me, for my mental health? Just be there for me? Maybe I am too selfish for wanting someone to care for me like that. I can understand it can be exhausting to care for someone with depression, suicidal thoughts, undiagnosed mental health problems and does sh. Whole package. But yeah.. I don’t want the fake caring, and telling me random things like it will make everything better, some don’t even validate my choices, feelings and they do it constantly. 

I’m tired of being that friend that always remembers small things and tries to cheer em up, tries to work with their wants and please them somehow. I’m really tired of everything. I just want someone to care for me without me being guilty about it, constantly thinking that if it’s too much to ask them for help and if I’m just a burden. 

Is there no one that can remember those small things about me, know me really, don’t judge me, read thru my bullshit, come knocking on my door even tho I said I don’t want it or I’m just fine?

My grandma usually just stays quiet and barely speaks, and when we do talk she usually just talks over me and talks about herself all the time, i cook meals, clean the house and do laundry by myself when were the only ones home together because she wont do anything unless asked.

I know it sounds really selfish of me to be talking like this but its really driving me crazy, whenever me and my mom are together for long periods we just fight and she calls me mean and doesn’t let me get a word in and if i do it just ads fuel to the fire.

,depression,"I hate this. I hate this so fucking much. He won't talk to me anymore. I saw one of those stupid bullshit ""this is how he curves you"" listicles and I didn't know the term so I clicked it.

Guess what he's been doing for the past two months? Guess who feels like the biggest dipshit in the world? I can trace it back to the night he ""passed out on the floor of his room."" Full disclosure, we're LDR for a year and a month now. The guaranteed twice daily phone calls became once a day, and never again when he was completely off his ass drunk. Then he just stopped texting at all when he was drunk. Daily phone calls grew shorter and shorter, until it was the five minutes before he had to race out the door. For about a month now, even those have stopped and it has been days since we last spoke. This is after literally 11 months of daily twice a day conversations, even if they were just ""hey I'm really beat. But I love you, chat tomorrow"". So something feels fucking off and I'm tired of pretending I'm okay with it.

I'm either about to end the one good thing that has kept me going this entire godforsaken pandemic, or finally get it through his thick skull that I am *fucking* hurting and need more than just the occasional ""hey"".

I haven't had a single hug since NYE and before then August. I'm hurting in so many ways that are completely selfish, but the ONE THING I felt like I had for myself has decided he is tired of me and fuck me I can only think about how badly I want to be in his arms again.

If you've read this far, he's an expat living and working primarily in China. I literally cannot get a visa right now. I'm so fucking tired. I miss him so badly. I just want him to come back to me.

Give me the fucking time of day.

The guaranteed twice daily phone calls became once a day, and never again when he was completely off his ass drunk. Then he just stopped texting at all when he was drunk. Daily phone calls grew shorter and shorter, until it was the five minutes before he had to race out the door. For about a month now, even those have stopped and it has been days since we last spoke. This is after literally 11 months of daily twice a day conversations, even if they were just &amp;quot;hey I&amp;#39;m really beat. But I love you, chat tomorrow&amp;quot;.

,depression,"Hello reddit.

I feel like I need to write this off my chest, if you bother to read this, thanks.

I was officially diagnosed with PTSD and depression some years ago so I went to therapy until I've quit. I felt much better after and managed to go through my job training for 3 years. Those 3 years were absolute hell and my former boss took full advantage of my mental health despite knowing where I came from. Now I went back to school to get a better degree so I can apply for better jobs/university. This is where my trouble starts again.

The last few years wore me down pretty drastically, despite having some successes in my life (successful job training, relatively good school degree after) I am now once again in the position to apply for new jobs. And I can't handle it. I only managed to write 5 applications so far and my nerves are already blank. If I do not find anything until June/July/August I will most likely lose my apartment.

The uncertainty kills me. I feel unwanted and useless  and maybe I am. I always had trouble with myself in my private life (being 25 &amp; never had a relationship so far, being lonely generally, social pressure, characteristics about me that I absolutely hate, and so on...) and I pretty much depend on my mother financially every now and then. Despite me being 25 yrs old with work experience.

,depression,"I signed up for Brightside and had my first consultation over Zoom today, they said my I may have generalized anxiety (?) but my depression is “severe”. It’s something I’ve been dealing with since high school (almost 30 now) and I didn’t really think to get help because my upbringing was very much hush hush about mental health.

My first Reddit post yesterday: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/m02y9t/new_to_reddit_and_trying_out_brightside_wish_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

My very supportive and loving significant other of 5+ years is just sitting in the other room unaware of what I’d done. I don’t know how to tell them, I’m embarrassed (?) or I feel like I’m a fraud somehow or being overdramatic?

I made a list of what I feel to prepare for the consultation today:

- Intrusive thoughts: usually a bit of a song or a name that incessantly repeats over and over and I can’t concentrate on anything else

- Sometimes, but not always, paralyzed to talk to people. Almost always feeling paralyzed to clean, to brush my teeth or shower sometimes.

- Before cleaning or starting work, everything has to be a certain way, I need tools and a general plan to complete everything efficiently and that’s why I feel like I’m paralyzed sometimes? I get overwhelmed and don’t know where to start and often just get stuck in bed.

- Uncontrollable shaking, shortness of breath, heart palpitations in certain situations when interacting with people (strangers?)

- No energy, feel foggy, use caffeine at work to feel not sluggish but don’t feel present or alert

- Always worried about what people are thinking about me, even close friends and I worry I’m annoying to them. Or that they’ll find out or they already know I’m a horrible person and don’t want to be friends with me.

- Feel like everyone is watching me when I am outside. Even going to the yard outside, worried about my neighbor thinking I won’t pick up my dog’s poop and that they hate me.

- Feel like I’ll get found out at work that I’m not so great after all, that I don’t know anything or unqualified to do my job

- Go back and forth between thinking how I’m feeling is normal and everyone goes through this so maybe I am just lazy. And other times I’m thinking my family clearly has undiagnosed mental health issues and it’s a real thing and I probably need help because I am not a professional

Last fall I tried to give my best to complete my semester at the university the best I can do, because I was a first year once again. It went well, until we had to switch to online courses because of the pandemic. There the teachers were especially angry at the situation and most of them blamed us for some reason. 3 or 4 of them punished us for this by making almost impossible tests and exams. By that time I started to feel overwhelmed, because it became extremely hard to simply just pass any of these courses while I had to fight my own battle with depression and anxiety.  


During the exams period it went quite well, until I had an oral exam in Linear Algebra. I tried to study as much as I can despite all the bad things happening around me. I felt the problems from the beginning, like despite me studying hours and hours through the day, nothing seemed to be kept in my memory. I forgot everything so fast like never before. This stressed the sh\*t out of me, and when the day of the exam came I simply broke down. We were in a video call with the teacher and I had to call out theorems and definitions, then I had to prove them. For the first 4 minutes it went well, but then suddenly I forgot something very basic. I was just saying whatever I could and I kind of made a fool of myself. The teacher thought I studied nothing for her exam and told me that my performance was ""shameful"".  


After this failure I could never look at any kind of mathematical thing without bursting out in tears. It's not enough that I hate everything that keeps happening around me. My depression and anxiety became so much worse that psychosomatic symptom started to develop. I literally scratched every inch of my body I could reach, because of the unstoppable itching. I scratched my skin so much that my whole body is covered by scratches, wounds and cuts. Also the amount of stress I had to experience made my head hurt all the time, my digestive system started malfunctioning as well (constant diarrhea, nausea and reflux keept happening). Also I lost interest in everything I do. I can't just listen to music, play video games, watch movies because I can't find any happiness in them anymore.  


After I got enough of these I decided to make a second attempt (years after the first one) to take away my own life. A bottle of wine + tons of antidepressants, sedative pills and painkillers.

I know there is a drug trazadone that elevates seratonin levels in a more immediate way than SSRI's. Is that something I could take? Or something like it? I need something for the 3-6 hour periods of depression I'm having at night.

,depression,"My husband (45/m) and I (37/F) have been married for 11 years and we have two boys (7 &amp; 9).  

My aunt committed suicide in 1991 when she was 17 years old.  Mental health issues were taboo in the 90s- and especially taboo in my family.  However, my aunt’s death made my mother (her sister) more aware of mental health issues within our family and I was lucky enough to have been provided the right kind of care in my teens.

I’ve run the gamut of therapies and medications and know that treatment of depression isn’t like treatment of a broken arm.  There’s not a one-size fits all approach to medicating and handling depression and needs change over time.

I’ve also learned, through therapy, to look for outward signs that my medication isn’t working.  Since depression is a mental health game, it’s so easy to fall back into the trap of “I’m worthless” if you’re on medication and it’s not working as well as it should.  The first trap is thinking, “See? This is just how I am.  Not even medicine can fix me.”  However, going on mental clues alone is a dangerous game, as the depression makes you feel hopeless.

The biggest physical sign that my depression medicine isn’t working well is how I keep my living space.  I’m not a clean freak by any means, but I’ve never been what I consider to be “filthy.”  Messy? Yes.  Filthy?  Well, when I start doing filthy things in my living space, then I know something is wrong.  Filthy for me is leaving dirty utensils and half-eaten plates of food out instead of putting them away.  Having empty cans of club soda all over the house. Or avoiding the dirtier chores, like cleaning toilets.

My husband was diagnosed with depression a few years ago and he still struggles with accepting that it is a mental health issue and not a matter of character.  We have our 9 year old son starting therapy, as the signs are there that the boy is struggling.  His school sees it and we see it.

Lately, my husband and I have both been in a rough spot with our mental health and it took me awhile to notice that we were living in a filthy way.  Empty cans everywhere, every kitchen cabinet open, food in all the bedrooms.

But the absolute worst is the situation with our dogs.  We rescued both our dogs from the animal shelter and neither are house trained.  We had been working on it, but then we stopped.

What this has resulted in is the dogs pissing and shitting all throughout the house.  We’ve ALWAYS immediately cleaned it (the depression isn’t THAT uncontrolled), but our house has become an open sewer for the dogs and I fucking hate it.

Leave a towel on the floor in the bathroom? Guarantee the dogs will shit on it.  Go to the kitchen? There’s a pool of piss on the floor.  

It got so bad, that I isolated myself in the bedroom and banned the dogs from coming into the room because I didn’t want to deal with it.  I started nesting in there.

At the time you don’t recognize it happening.  It happens slowly.  But yesterday I told myself that enough is enough - I’m going into the bedrooms and getting all the garbage and cleaning.

I walked to the kitchen with garbage from my room and I looked at the floor.  The light was hitting it in such a way that I could see dog paw prints and my children’s footprints shining back at me.  I started to look at the floor more closely and in other areas of the house and I saw how dirty the floors had become.  I grabbed some paper towels and the spray and started to clean.

It was only then that I realized how bad it had become.  Those footprints and paw prints were not made of dirt or water.  They were made from the dogs and kids stepping in dog pee and trailing it throughout sections of the house.

I lost it.  How long had I let this go on?  I was deeply ashamed.

I called my husband over and showed him the footprints and paw prints and I expected him to be equally horrified.  Instead, he acted annoyed and started mopping the floor.  He said, “You know, I’m not the only person in this house who know how to clean dog piss.”

I said this is much, much bigger than cleaning up dog piss.  This is about what’s happened to our mental health.  “Normal” people don’t live like this.  They aren’t letting their animals use their house as a toilet.  They aren’t letting garbage pile up in their bedrooms.  They aren’t avoiding simple tasks like cleaning a toilet.  I told him that something is really wrong - with both of us - and we both need to make appointments with our respective doctors.

He shrugged.

I lost my cool and started sobbing and asked him to come to the bedroom with me to talk.

I asked him if he hated himself and he said, “Yea, but you know that.”  I asked him if things felt hopeless.  He said they always do.  I told him that it didn’t have to be that way and that I really want him to go back to his doctor.  That I’m going back, too, because things are so bad right now.

He didn’t agree.  He said this is just how things are.  Life doesn’t get better.  The same old bullshit depression tells us to think.  I tried a few more times to get through to him and he wasn’t agreeing.  I think in his mind, this was the same old argument about cleaning and keeping up with the house.  But it wasn’t that for me.

Finally, I said to him, “I don’t want to lose our son.” And shared with him how terrified I am that our 9 year old son is going down the same mental health pathway.  Yes, we have him in therapy, but his doctor will not medicate a child his age and the therapy isn’t doing much.  I shared with him that I’m terrified that our son might commit suicide in his teens like my aunt did.

I told him that we need to get OUR shit together to help our son.  Even if I can’t convince my husband not to hate himself, I can convince him to do what we need to do for our son.  

I said we need to be the example for him.  If he feels things are hopeless (which he has said in therapy), then my husband and I need to show him that there’s always hope.  We need to show him a positive, healthy, clean living environment.  We need to model a health attitude towards mental health issues and cleaning the house is the first step.

My husband said he doesn’t understand what the house had to do with anything, so I told him that our house is a reflection of our minds.  

We spent all day cleaning the house yesterday and got it back into a much better place.

I tried a few more times to get through to him and he wasn’t agreeing.  I think in his mind, this was the same old argument about cleaning and keeping up with the house.  But it wasn’t that for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I said to him, “I don’t want to lose our son.” And shared with him how terrified I am that our 9 year old son is going down the same mental health pathway.  Yes, we have him in therapy, but his doctor will not medicate a child his age and the therapy isn’t doing much.  I shared with him that I’m terrified that our son might commit suicide in his teens like my aunt did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him that we need to get OUR shit together to help our son.  Even if I can’t convince my husband not to hate himself, I can convince him to do what we need to do for our son.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said we need to be the example for him.  If he feels things are hopeless (which he has said in therapy), then my husband and I need to show him that there’s always hope.  We need to show him a positive, healthy, clean living environment.  We need to model a health attitude towards mental health issues and cleaning the house is the first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband said he doesn’t understand what the house had to do with anything, so I told him that our house is a reflection of our minds.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent all day cleaning the house yesterday and got it back into a much better place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depression can be a cruel bitch - take care of yourselves, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"This post is about sharing my thoughts and experiences with escapism. If you aren’t interested you don’t have to read the post.

Escapism: the tendency to seek distraction and relief from unpleasant realities, especially by seeking entertainment or engaging in fantasy

I’ve been thinking about this term lately, escapism, and how it applies to my life. I think this is something a lot of us might do without even realizing it. 

It can be something as simple as going on your phone, something I definitely do. Before I knew this term I thought I was fine. Maybe I would have bad thoughts sometimes, but it’s not like I couldn’t live without my phone... right?  

I began noticing patterns in my daily routine. Wake up, go on my phone, eat, sleep, and repeat. It began feeling repetitive and boring. But, when I tried to leave my phone for an old hobby I once enjoyed... I couldn’t. I would put my phone down and suddenly I felt as if my world was crashing down. All the bad thoughts that I tried to not think about came flooding into my head. The rush was so overbearing that sometimes I would cry. 

This is when I knew that this wasn’t just going-on-your-phone-like-normal-teenagers-do type of thing. It was escapism. It turned into an addiction. Something that became very hard to stop. Something I felt I couldn’t control. It might seem dumb. “Just put the phone down”, you must be thinking. But, it’s actually pretty hard for someone with escapist tendencies, like myself. 

What I think is escapist don’t like to deal or even think about their problems. It obviously doesn’t make them feel good so they just hide it away and distract themselves with something else. But once you take that something away, the problems they tried to hide could no longer stay hidden. The solution would be to tackle the issue instead of hiding it. But, of course that is also a very difficult thing that even I am still trying to figure out.

Although it is still hard for me to deal with my thoughts and emotions, I think I’m at least taking a step in the right direction by acknowledging a problem I have. I decided to write this because I was hoping it would really help other people going through a situation like this, especially if they don’t even realize it.

Now here are the questions: Why is a serotonin precursor allowed but not others? What stops some company from shipping out tyrosine or gaba precursors? 

Despite my seemingly negative stance because I think having these otc could be abused, I do think there is some potential into using precursors for treatment. 5-htp has already been investigated with average results, but I'm not sure DA and NE precursors have been investigated for depression. Perhaps a combination treatment could be pursued. After all, we have newer antidepressants that are partial agonists. Since I myself have MDD, I won't give up the fight in looking for new research when it comes up.

But now when i get fire stuff it feels like i cant do this stuff much anymore because im always worried about my heart and stuff. Like somtimes when i take one hit of the pipe my neck blood vessels kinda throb in like a hurting pain slightly. Or it feels hard to swallow. And i use to only do meth for the majority of the time but now a so called “friend” got me into blues (fentanyl) and now its just been f*cking everying thing up because im mixing meth with that and smoking cigarettes. And its not good. I was telling myself for the last few days that i do wanna quit and take a break just to show my parents that they can be proud of me and that i can finally see myself be something or someone good in this world.

,depression,"My brain is stuck in the past. 

Some context: when I graduated from high school I graduated with honours, and had several scholarships and bursaries to go to university. I was planning on going to medical school. I was definitely smart enough to do it, but I don’t know what happened. In my second year I failed half my courses, lost all scholarships and bursaries, and never fully recovered. I went from double majoring in biology/psychology, to just trying to scrape by with a psych major. By this point I had already given up on becoming a surgeon, but still had hope for psychiatry. But my grades never fully recovered. It was never good enough. And I don’t understand because I’m not stupid, and I studied day in and day out. I had no social life. Studying was all my life was, and yet it still wasn’t good enough. 

I tried to stick with it for a few more years, up until last semester. When I was told that I would be stuck for yet another full year I decided I couldn’t do it anymore and dropped out.

&lt;p&gt;Some context: when I graduated from high school I graduated with honours, and had several scholarships and bursaries to go to university. I was planning on going to medical school. I was definitely smart enough to do it, but I don’t know what happened. In my second year I failed half my courses, lost all scholarships and bursaries, and never fully recovered. I went from double majoring in biology/psychology, to just trying to scrape by with a psych major. By this point I had already given up on becoming a surgeon, but still had hope for psychiatry. But my grades never fully recovered. It was never good enough. And I don’t understand because I’m not stupid, and I studied day in and day out. I had no social life. Studying was all my life was, and yet it still wasn’t good enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to stick with it for a few more years, up until last semester. When I was told that I would be stuck for yet another full year I decided I couldn’t do it anymore and dropped out. I was at the start of my 6th year of what should’ve been a 4-year program. I still live in the town (small-town university). &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Sorry, if my title sounds suicidal, but I really don't know what the fuck I had been doing for the past 23 years, other than being extremely timid, immature, and indecisive, fretting and avoiding any sort of confrontations, getting scared for no reason, and not being able to communicate my own desires to anyone. 

I've let down almost everyone who has been a part in my life. I've been a disappointment to them. Neither could o communicate my own opinions or desires to them, nor am I able to fulfill their expectations. My parents have wasted their time and money on me. My friends have been so caring and affectionate to me, and a jackass like me, doesn't deserve their pure love. All I did, was to let them down. I don't know why I'm even living. 

I do have the feeling that I'm being misunderstood by everyone around me. Nobody is ready to listen to me. But that's my fault as well, since I don't open up to them, due to the fear of being judged or neglected by them. 

At the end of the day, I feel as if I've lost my own self. What exists is just a shallow reflection, which has no soul or desire. 

I don't even have the courage to opt for suicide. But I do have suicidal thoughts, and I don't know how to get past it.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve let down almost everyone who has been a part in my life. I&amp;#39;ve been a disappointment to them. Neither could o communicate my own opinions or desires to them, nor am I able to fulfill their expectations. My parents have wasted their time and money on me. My friends have been so caring and affectionate to me, and a jackass like me, doesn&amp;#39;t deserve their pure love. All I did, was to let them down. I don&amp;#39;t know why I&amp;#39;m even living. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have the feeling that I&amp;#39;m being misunderstood by everyone around me. Nobody is ready to listen to me. But that&amp;#39;s my fault as well, since I don&amp;#39;t open up to them, due to the fear of being judged or neglected by them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I feel as if I&amp;#39;ve lost my own self. What exists is just a shallow reflection, which has no soul or desire. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I've been suffering from depression over the last 3 and a half years and general anxiety disorder for an year and a half . It started with mild insomnia, nightmares and turned into frequent nightmares and episodes of just crying. I've even gone on for days without food, shower and sleep. I went to a therapist and psychiatrist, after consistent follow ups for few months I kinda started to understand little by little why I feel the way I feel. I've kept it from my family even though I have the most loving family and only my best friends know about this, but even they don't know the extent it goes.

Due to COVID, I've had to go back to my hometown and I haven't been able to do certain things that I used to do to keep myself in check and over the last few months things have become worse. 

It's hard to believe I have this issue because I was good at studies and efficient at work. I am a private person and striking up conversation with people doesn't come naturally to me, but, I do have good communication skills. I've tried sharing my struggles with my friends but I feel like I make them sad and spoil their mood. I escape from parties or outings most of the time fearing that I might bring down the mood of the people involved. At home, I lock myself in my room hiding from visitors and sometimes even my family. I care about these people deeply but I fail to express it. My silence and reserved nature is often misinterpreted as arrogance.

I get up late and spend my entire weekend on bed and lie to everyone saying that my workload is too much and I need to rest. In reality, I don't feel like getting out of bed. I feel this constant wave of sadness all the time. I cant sleep, no matter how hard I try. I will be awake as late as 3-4 am. I cry myself to bed and most of the time I don't know why. Some days when I sleep, I wake up due to nightmares and they feel as if they are happening to me in reality. I sometimes wake up to things that I've experienced and enjoyed but morphed into nightmares, for ex: a roller coaster ride in an amusement park. I sometimes hear voices screaming in terror. I get this thought that I may not get up from sleep, or the ceiling fan falls and kills me when I'm asleep or a whole lot of other things. I have my grandparents at my house and they are both 85+ and I fear that something might happen to them and it makes me go check up on them without being noticed. 
I can't sleep because of the lingering thought that there is nothing to life and what difference does it make if I live or die. I scream into my pillow. I constantly get suicidal thoughts.
I don't believe in god but I pray that I die in an accident or an incurable disease so I'm not responsible for my death and my family won't be blamed for it. I'm tired of living like this. I hope that I was never born and I'm just tired of existence. Some days I feel totally fine that I start questioning myself if I'm depressed. I see less fortunate people who find it difficult to put bread on the plate and blame myself that I don't have real problems and feel guilty to reach out for help.

I'm just putting it here to know if it gets better with time. I'm looking for a tiny fragment of hope but also being skeptic about it at the same time. Is hope really worth holding on to?

I'd heard that Evangelion dealt with issues such as depression, loneliness, despair,... So some time ago, I gave it a watch.  
And ever since I started watching NGE two years ago, I've been obsessed with it - really. Living in Belgium it can be quite a challenge to find all existing versions and footage of it, but I've been doing my best.  
I've watched the original series three times, I've read almost all essays on character analysis, and still, I can't let it go.  
It frightens me, it speaks to me, it shows me I'm not all alone.

When I can't get out of bed, I listen to Kom Susser Tod. Every snippet of audio or visuals of the franchise reminds me: it's okay to feel bad, someone is there with you.  
I was sitting on trains mindlessly listening to the same songs over and over again from even before I met Shinji, and seeing him doing that, seeing his struggles, his inability to have healthy connections with the people around him, gave me such a feeling of understanding, of warmth even. You are (not) alone, one of the movies said, and lo and behold, I did feel less alone - and that gave so much hope! 

Even when I rewatch the series I feel frightened for every passing frame, because that means I'm one step closer to the ending once more - the ending I still don't fully understand, or want to understand.  
And especially today, now I see 'Goodbye, all of Evangelion.' all but everywhere, I'm so so so very scared. I don't want Shinji to leave.  
I even felt some relief every single time the last movie was delayed - it was one more day, one more week Evangelion was still alive, running, kicking and crying.  
And now I hear One Last Kiss and I can mentally see the credits rolling and inside I feel more alone in my depression than ever.

I know how stupid it all sounds, but I've always had a hard time connecting to other people, and I never connected with something quite as much as I did with the Evangelion franchise. I felt understood. I felt less alone.   
It was an anchor, oddly enough - how a damn anime series can be an anchor for one's mental health, it's unbelievable. But still, I lost an anchor today, and I am more adrift than ever.

,depression,"Hey friends, I'll keep it short. My husband has some very serious depression (in addition to other mental health issues) since childhood, stemming from a very violent and volatile household. He's been in and out of therapy and on and off all shorts of medication. Right now he's not doing either. 

I've never had depression like what he is experiencing, but I'm getting close to the point of needing to leave him for my own mental health and our kids' mental health too. Unfortunately, my husband has just completely stopped participating in life. He works, he comes home, eats dinner, and goes to bed. He spends the weekends laying in bed too and when we ask him to get up, he tells us that he's too tired, but I know it's because he's depressed.

His depression is starting to affect our marriage and our kids, who don't understand why daddy won't read a book with them or go for a walk with us. He'll eat junk food with the kids, but that's about it. Then he's back into bed. 

I've been encouraging him to seek counseling again, but he won't talk to anyone. I don't want to encourage him to take antidepressants because the last time he took them, he started sleepwalking at night and falling asleep randomly during the day. Besides encouraging him to seek professional treatment, I try to be as encouraging as possible at home. I thank him when he takes out the trash or tell him he looks good when he actually showers and brushes his teeth. But I've finally reached the point that I can't talk to him, not even to say things like that, because when he does talk to me, it's nothing but negative thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Don't get me wrong, I care about him and want to help him, but we need to talk about other things besides how sad he is. 

I'm now having to make important family and life decisions without him, because if I bring anything up, he gets even more depressed (for example, I haven't bothered to tell him that our son needs a cavity filled because telling him would lead into a long list of why everything is wrong with his life and the cavity is just another thing to add to the list). 

I've reached the point that I think it might be easier on me and the kids if we leave, but I don't want to give up on our marriage and family and future together. I love him too much to throw in the towel now. But I don't know what else to do.
